      sufficiently comprehensive knowledge to definitively make such a claim given
      the complexity of the brain and the almost inevitable lack of comprehensive

  - "I don't think you should use nasal cavity, since it is an immaterial entity.\
    \ However, you could use [nasal cavity respiratory epithelium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005385).\
    \ Also, I think that it important to highlight that this cells are in submucosal\
    \ glands (PMID:11005715). In this article you can find additional information:\r\
    \n> The serous secretory cells had round to oval nuclei, which were largely euchromatic,\
    \ and which tended to be situated in the lower half of the cells.\r\n\r\nI have\
    \ only done a cursory search, so probably you can find more updated details.\r\
    \n\r\nIn the article there is the synonym `nasal mucous secretory cell`"
  - It is missing a relationship to nose. I suggest [nasal cavity respiratory epithelium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005385).
    Also, probably it can be all together an EquivalentTo.

    - '@aleixpuigb '
    - SMG stands for submucosal gland which is the region of this cell type in the
      nasal cavity. I am getting more information from research group as this is part
      of lung combined HLCA
    - Since there is not a `nasal submucosal gland`, it would be good that this cell
      term is also `'part of' some 'submucosal gland'`, and if the Uberon term is
      created it will be reasoned.
    - 'I was working up a new list of NTRs and this was on it with appropriate uberon
      NTRs. '
    - Probably a silly question but what is NTR?

    \ morphology with spiny dendrites concentrating on L1 of the cortex, and has a\
    \ burst firing electrophysiological signature with highly dynamic dendritic spines."
  - as discussed in [the ticket](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/2355#issuecomment-2222451266),
    I think this is an exact synonym.
  - A relationship to neocortex present in the ticket is missing. Perhaps, has soma
    location in some neocortex??
  - "Do you think this could be an Equivalent to?\r\n'[vip GABAergic cortical interneuron](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_4023016)'\
    \ and ('capable of' some '[acetylcholine secretion, neurotransmission](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0014055)')"
  - Vip --> VIP
  - Vip --> VIP
  - Cool! Done!
  - Changed!
  - "the first sentence of the definition states:\r\n> A VIP GABAergic cortical interneuron\
    \ with a soma located in L1-3 of some neocortex in Mmus."
  - Weird I thought I changed all of these. anyways I will have a look with this next
    commit
  - Yes, but is missing logically.
  - We normally use the intersections for equivalent to, but for this I would have
    two separate axioms.
  - "There is still one vip lower case (they hide well!)\r\n\"...restricted than deeper\

  - Yes they do! thank you!

  - This looks wrong. Many blood vessel endothelial cells are squamous.
  - '"A`n` endothelial cell..."'
  - Since this term has an EquivalentTo, shouldn't it have an automatically created
    definition?
  - The ORCID is a literal. Please, add in the IRI editor.
  - It's created as a post-process, it's not added to the edit file.
  - It's using the dc_elements:contributor, that we don't use anymore. Need to use
    terms:contributor.
  - That's why the QC is failing.
  - Can we remove annotation properties that we don't use anymore and cause the QC
    fail? It creates confusion.
  - Is it added to the -simple file?

  - "@dosumis here's the change that broke the owl \U0001F62C "
  - I'm not sure, we're importing OMO, which is where it comes from. It's important
    to make sure you use the correct annotation, and the QC is there to help you.

    - '''cell cycle process'' is it too general I think. Maybe use [M-Phase](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/go/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FGO_0000279?lang=en)

      people doing the annotations.  Not sure how proliferating might be distinct.
      For the relation - maybe ''[participates in](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/go/properties/http%253A%252F%252Fpurl.obolibrary.org%252Fobo%252FRO_0000056)''
      would be sufficient? Despite the name, this doesn''t have  implications of capability.  It

      this is based on [Travaglini](doi: 10.1038/s41586-020-2922-4.) and more recent

    - "Thank you for submitting this term. \r\n\r\nI am unsure if this cell is a subclass\
      \ of `granulosa cell` or if it differentiates from them. In CL, `cumulus cell`\
      \ differentiates from `granulosa cell`, and [Yamochi et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33970370)\
      \ states that both cumulus and mural granulosa cells differentiate from `granulosa\
      \ cell`. However, other sources ([Dompe et al., 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8229878/),\
      \ [Kordus and LaVoie,2021](https://rep.bioscientifica.com/view/journals/rep/153/2/R69.xml),\

      \ treat them as subtypes of granulosa cells. We might need to ask SMEs for clarification,\

    - "@aleixpuigb I think the difficulty is that the ovarian follicle is a developing\
      \ anatomical structure which undergoes several stages of differentiation depending\
      \ upon what hormones they are exposed to during the normal state of a woman's\
      \ hormonal cycle.  During follicle maturation, there are distinct developmental\
      \ states and most papers refer in general to a granulosa cell layer, but whether\
      \ 1 layer or 2 layers exist depends on the state of follicle maturation. \r\n\
      I think it's important to incorporate the follicle stage in the definitions\
      \ for cumulus and mural granulosa cells and make it distinct from granulosa\
      \ single layer which is present at earlier follicle stages.\r\nRight now there\
      \ is primary follicular cell of ovary CL:0002175 with terse definition: A cell\
      \ within the primary follicle of the ovary. and secondary follicular cell of\
      \ ovary CL:0002176 with terse definition: A cell of a secondary follicile within\
      \ the ovary.\r\nEach month in adult female ovary some of the Primordial follicles\
      \ differentiate into primary follicles--> secondary follicles --> tertiary follicles\
      \ (also known as Graafian follicles.) So depending on stage, depends on what\
      \ the granulosa cell layer looks like.\r\nThere are 2 types of granulosa cells\
      \ that can be distinguished in different layers around the oocyte: mural granulosa\
      \ cell surround antrum and produce estrogen during follicle development stage\
      \ and progesterone after ovulation,  and cumulus granulosa cell tightly surround\
      \ oocyte.\r\nIn the [Yamochi et al., 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33970370)\
      \ paper they state that there are pre-granulosa cells in primordial follicles.\
      \  Those should also be captured in CL.\r\nIn general Uberon did not have ovarian\
      \ follicle development fully represented. The ASCT+B table for ovary reflected\

  - I think you were right about [L2 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic neuron](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_4030060),
    my concerns were not on the layer, but on the intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic
    neuron, as I had to do more reading.
  - Since this is a new way for defining cells, it should be included to the editor
    SOP. IMO I would not include this in the definition, but I believe it has been
    discussed elsewhere to adopt this style for cellxgene new terms.
  - Please, include 'has_synonym_type' abbreviaiton.

  - "> a pia matter\r\n-->\r\nthe pia mater"
  - Also wrong AP? Text showing up as on dbxref rather than comment in diff.
  - It is fixed now
  - Consider adding 'connected to' some pia mater'
  - 'Suggest: " A cell type with highly branched protrusions, found in neocortex layers
    2-6, typically involved with the formation and elimination of synapses, glutamate
    clearance, modulation of synaptic functions and regulation of blood flow in response
    to synaptic activity."'
  - Suggest "A cell type located in the white matter of the cerebral cortex that provides
    structural and metabolic support through long fibre-like processes that extend
    along the white matter tract and remain in close contact with the vasculature
    of the nervous system."
  - 'Suggest: "A cell type located in the first layer of the neocortex with radial
    protrusions extending transversely into the deeper cortex layers, herby facilitating
    communication across neurons, astrocytes, capillaries, meninges and cerebrospinal
    fluid through contact with neurons, pia mater and capillaries."'
  - "\"A cell type...\" --> \"An astrocyte...\"\r\n\r\nThe original def mentions several\
    \ contacts with the vasculature but the suggested new one makes it sound like\
    \ the process remain in contact with the vasculature.  Need to make this clear."
  - "Suggest: \"An astrocyte with highly branched protrusions, found in neocortex\

  - "\r\nA ~~cell type~~ _astrocyte_ located in the first layer of the neocortex with\

    \ ..\r\n\r\nALso consider moving structural information - contact with pia mater\

  comments:
  - Consider "A myoepithelial cell that is part of a mammary gland"
  - There might be a typo. Did you mean "basal-myoepithelial cell"?
  - No, in this case is only basal, as the author of the publication uses it to refer
    this cell type instead of using the long name.
  - Thank you!

      ### borderline associated macrophage\r\n\r\nIn the literature there seems to\

      \n\r\nIn one of the references provided (PMID:[37232741](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37232741)),\
      \ we have the following statements about different morphologies depending the\
      \ subclass:\r\n- `The subpopulations of BAMs generally vary in morphology, motility,\
      \ and function.`\r\n- `The BAM subpopulations and microglia generally vary in\
      \ morphology. Meningeal macrophages are flat, spindle-shaped cells with a few\
      \ thick membrane projections from their cell body residing close to meningeal\
      \ vessels . Although sd\u039C\u03A6 appeared elongated with a more amoeboid\
      \ morphology than microglia, dm\u039C\u03A6 was also suggested to be pleomorphic\
      \ and dendriform-like cells . In the same context, the pv\u039C\u03A6 had elongated\
      \ cell bodies permitting the embedding within vessel walls . Regarding the choroid\
      \ plexus, cp\u039C\u03A6 display a star-like shape, while cpepi\u039C\u03A6\
      \ seem more phenotypically diverse, varying from round to bipolar to stellate.`\r\

      \ macrophage, I would also add as exact synonyms: \"border associated macrophage\"\

  - "I added \"in Human, Rhesus Macaque, and Marmoset\" specifically because the TAC3-positive\
    \ interneurons have been observed only in those species. In [PMID:32999462](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2781-z)\
    \ they detect TAC3-positive interneurons in human and marmoset but not in rodents.\
    \ It seems that in other species this cell type has not been detected (so far).\r\
    \n\r\nspecifically these interneurons are described in Rhesus Macaque in [PMID:34727523](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.10.015),\
    \ and in Marmoset and Human in [PMID:32999462](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2781-z).\
    \ The latter specify the absence of TAC3-positive interneurons in other species:\

    \ raised the question of whether it had replaced\u2014or supplemented\u2014conserved\

    \ in the striatum overall: whereas interneurons consisted of 5.1% of all striatal\
    \ neurons in the ferret and 4.1% of all striatal neurons in mice, they consisted\
    \ of 13.1% of all striatal neurons in marmosets and 10.8% in humans, which is\

    \ in the primate striatum[43](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2781-z#ref-CR43).\
    \ Thus, compared to ferrets and mice, the primate striatum has more than doubled\

      \ retinal cell? \r\n- why is photopic receptor cell not classified under visual\
      \ system neuron?\r\n- why isn't ON-blue cone bipolar cell not classified under\
      \ retinal cone cell?\r\n- the classification of photopic receptor cell seems\
      \ massively incomplete?\r\n- etc\r\n\r\nOverall it looks like there are just\
      \ too many axes of classification going on with insufficient axiomatization\
      \ to render them complete\r\n\r\nIn some cases it seems like CL has grouping\
      \ classes that are just inherently hard to make complete. E.g. my understanding\
      \ is that role in photopic vision is not discrete. cones are typically photopic,\
      \ rods typically scotopic, but this is not all or nothing (if it were, then\
      \ there would be no need for a distinct \"photopic receptor cell\" classification)\r\
      \n\r\nSome of these groupings may be historic - e.g it looks like both photopic\
      \ and scotopic receptor cells have been there from the early days of CL, and\
      \ they are undefined. These could probably be obsoleted. \r\n\r\nThe classification\
      \ here appears wrong:\r\n\r\n* [] CL:0000210 ! photoreceptor cell\r\n    * [i]\
      \ **CL:0000489 ! scotopic photoreceptor cell**\r\n    * [i] CL:0000488 ! visible\
      \ light photoreceptor cell\r\n        * [i] **CL:0000490 ! photopic photoreceptor\
      \ cell**\r\n\r\nAFAIK, both scotopic and photopic are visible, the distinction\
      \ is to do with light levels. `visible light photoreceptor cell` is also massively\
      \ incomplete - other than photopic, it only has fly neurons.\r\n\r\nI can see\
      \ a number of challenges with making axiomatization complete here related to\
      \ species specificity. There is a lot of tacit information to navigate around;\
      \ we have the terrible GO-ish \"camera-type eye\" which needs to be fixed in\
      \ GO and Uberon, there is also the fact that \"retina\" is used for the vertebrate\
      \ structure, and the more generic photoreceptor array used for adult Drosophila\
      \ retinal cells. And there are the usual annoying exceptions to photoreceptors\
      \ being found in retinas. In fact CL:0000210 photoreceptor cell could technically\
      \ be used by PO. \r\n\r\nThis is all compounded by the different uses of has-soma-location\
      \ vs part of in the ontology..."

    - "@bvarner-ebi @dosumis are you looking for superclass cell types of kidney that\
      \ would cover the majority of kidney cell types?\r\nSuperclass: kidney cell\
      \ CL:1000497 has all the major categories of specific cell types and when you\
      \ look at each subclass under and drill down into the most specific cell types,\
      \ this looks more on par with the cell types the HuBMAP folks captured in their\
      \ ASCT+B table.\r\n<img width=\"282\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-09-18 at 5 31 35\

      \ cell types?\r\nI'm not sure how the \"percent coverage\" is calculated?\r\n\
      Percent coverage of kidney cell types or what is this referring to here?"

  - 'Consider adding hasSynonymType: Plural'
  - Since 'apical papilla tooth root' is not present in Uberon, consider adding an

  - Also, consider adding the singular form (SCAP).
  - Since stem cell is broader than mesenchymal stem cell, I am thinking that it would
    be more adequate to be a broad synonym. Everything else looks good to me, so once
    the edit is done I will accept the PR.
  - OK
  - For the synonym type, please use OMO:0003004, as we have changed it in Uberon.

  - Yes thank you, this was discussed in Slack
  - Good you changed here already.
  - It's better to transfer the discussion to here to be transparent.

  comments:
  - ORCID as a string.
  - Thank you for noticing! As that passed the QC, should it be added?
  - It should be `oboInOwl:hasSynonymType` instead of `oboInOwl:hasRelatedSynonym`
    for the abbreviation `LumHR`.
  - I'll check it.
  - "- \"lactocyte\" is not defined in the ontology.\r\n- \"EPCAM\" <-- should this\
    \ be \"EpCAM\"?\r\n- \" ... and in mice, it can be... \" <-- comma should be removed\r\
    \n- \"TSPAN8\" <-- should this be \"Tspan8\"?"
  - See comments on other text def as some apply here as well.
  - Typically comments do not include multiple paragraphs. Unsure if this will cause
    downstream formatting issues.
  - Don't see this reflected in text def.
  - hormone sensing --> hormone-sensing
  - Consider if this should be considered a parent class rather than a broad synonym.
  - Consider if this is a narrow or exact synonym.
  - Corrected
  - Merged all in one paragraph
  - "Asking to SME about if all LHS cells have estrogen receptors:\r\n> LHS cells\
    \ are typically ESR1/ERa-high (they do NOT express ERb), especially in younger\
    \ women and mice, when hormone levels are high. In older women, ER levels can\
    \ drop off in at least some cells, but it is a pretty robust marker generally\
    \ speaking. In our experience, FOXA1 (a master TF of this lineage and pioneer\
    \ factor for ER) may be slightly more reliable than ER. \r\n\r\nAs I see it, even\
    \ if the levels are lower at certain points, if it is a robust marker it should\
    \ be included. I will add it to the textual definition."
  - Following the ER comment above, it should be an exact synonym.
  - As in the dbxref is used as a synonym, I would prefer to maintain it as a broad
    synonym.

      \ L4/5 IT_1, that was located on the boundary between L2/3 and L5 and probably\
      \ corresponds to the quasi-L4 neurons described previously in motor cortex.[31](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8113357/#CR31)\"\
      \r\n\r\nGiven this lack of specificity, the aggregation for L4 and L5 seems\
      \ reasonable in this case. \r\n\r\nAre you proposing to **replace** L4/5 with\
      \ L4 and L5 parent classes or to **keep** L4/5 and add L4 and L5?"
    - "Any one paper with layer information about a type is likely to focus on the\
      \ peculiarities of the layer structure of the region being studied.  IIRC, the\
      \ primary motor cortex lacks a clear layer 4 (unlike many other cortical regions),\
      \ but some the the location of the soma of some the type being discussed in\
      \ this paper fits with it being quasi-L4 in the PMC.  \r\n\r\nIt is clear that\
      \ we need a set of region-neutral terms for IT & ET projecting glutamatergic\
      \ neurons in the cortex.   To find out: for which layers can we justify adding\
      \ ET, IT or both. @jychien - can you provide refs for the papers you're curating\
      \ for these datasets (or are they pre-release?).  Also TBD - consistent system\
      \ for terms mentioning multiple regions.  I think easiest to have L4/5 as a\
      \ grouping term for neurons in L4 or 5  (so L4 & L5 are child terms) - but it's\
      \ worth noting that in this case it is referring to a distinct group of neurons\
      \ that sit between L2/3 and L5.\r\n\r\nPlease also note that we now have the\
      \ option to add an official symbol  (e.g. L5 ET) and have done so for at least\
      \ some terms.  I'd like to add these for well used symbols to enhance findability\
      \ and to provide an option for display where long names are not appropriate.\r\
      \n\r\nFinally - I think it would be worth having a more general call with folks\
      \ form the Allen who are working on these cell types to get their take on what's\
      \ needed.  We can't avoid that these names are being used based on annotation\
      \ transfer in cases were we don't have soma-location and projection info.  I\

    - I think if we keep terms in CL we need to do a good job of ensuring **reasonable
      completeness**. If we can't commit to doing this for somatic cell let's get
      rid of it, it's confusing as it is now as it is so incomplete
    - "Notes from CL call:\r\n  - No one gave an especially strong argument for keeping\
      \ the term so we suggest obsoletion.  However, before obsoletion we should check\
      \ completely for any usage in other ontologies (follow links to usage context\
      \ here: http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/CL?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FCL_0002371\

    - "Thank you for the questions, @jychien.\r\n\r\n>Is there a particular reason\
      \ the region of the brain was added to the term names?\r\n\r\nThe cross-references\
      \ for classes L2/3 - L5 are specific to motor cortex. The cross-reference for\
      \ the L6 class appears to be focussed on somatosensory cortex, so I cannot explain\
      \ that one.\r\n\r\n> The primary motor cortex is not referenced in the definition.\r\
      \n\r\nIt is referenced in all logical definitions for these classes and in all\
      \ text definitions except for 'L2/3 intratelencephalic projecting glutamatergic\
      \ neuron of the primary motor cortex'. The text definition for this class can\
      \ be updated to be aligned with the rest.\r\n\r\nThank you for the references.\
      \ The second reference appears to be focussed on primary motor cortex, so those\
      \ terms could be mapped to the already existing CL classes.\r\nGenerally, creating\
      \ a class that would have only one child (e.g., something like \"L2/3 intratelencephalic\
      \ projecting glutamatergic cortical neuron\") is discouraged unless you have\
      \ a specific use case. If you'd like to submit a NTR issue for these cell types\
      \ in other brain regions, please do so, and it will be added to the work queue."
    - "Thank you, @bvarner-ebi, for the explanation and pointing out the definitions\
      \ of the other children terms. And, I do agree that it's not ideal to create\
      \ classes with only one child, and that is why I hadn't initially created a\
      \ NTR ticket. \r\n\r\nThe more general question I have is at what point does\
      \ CL create new terms for cell types that are tissue location specific? Is there\
      \ a requirement of specific cell markers? It seems to be the current general\
      \ trend that authors that upload their data to CELLxGENE would rather not include\
      \ the tissue location in the cell type annotation, as they are not sure if there\
      \ is enough evidence to support cell type specificity based on location.\r\n\
      \r\nWe've been able to use the more general term (such as 'fibroblast') for\
      \ most cases. But for this case, if we use the parent term, there is information\
      \ loss since the layers are collectively categorized as L2/3-6. And, when looking\
      \ at the multiple brain datasets we have in CELLxGENE, only the cells that explicitly\
      \ mention the primary motor cortex could have the specific layer. It would give\
      \ a confusing user experience for people who, for example, want to look at different\
      \ layers.\r\n\r\nI don't really have a good solution, but getting a better understanding\
      \ would help us guide the process of picking the appropriate CL term."
    - "Thank you for the follow up, @jychien.\r\n\r\n> The more general question I\

      \ which may include specific cell markers, that should satisfy the requirement\
      \ to add a new class in CL. If the differentia is not immediately evident, the\
      \ requestor should submit a compelling reason to add the new class.\r\n\r\n\

      \ for example, want to look at different layers.\r\nI don't really have a good\
      \ solution, but getting a better understanding would help us guide the process\
      \ of picking the appropriate CL term.\r\n\r\nIn this case, if you have a reference\
      \ to support creating a new class of the form 'L{_N_} intratelencephalic projecting\
      \ glutamatergic neuron of the {_anatomical location_}', such as 'L2/3 intratelencephalic\
      \ projecting glutamatergic neuron of the somatosensory cortex', that could be\
      \ added."
    - 'This term came from the brain initiative atlas of the primary motor cortex.
      Because glutamatergic projection neurons do vary quite a lot between cortical
      regions, we were conservative (probably too conservative) adding region neutral
      terms for these.    The region restriction should be mentioned in the textual
      definition as well as the logical one, so the absence of this is an error. I
      am happy to support addition of a region neutral term. '
    - "Thank you @bvarner-ebi and @dosumis. It would be great if the region neutral\
      \ terms could be added as children of [L2/3-6 intratelencephalic projecting\
      \ glutamatergic cortical neuron](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FCL_4023040).\
      \ The corresponding terms with \" of primary motor cortex\" would then be children\
      \ of these new terms. Please let me know if I should create a separate ticket.\r\
      \n\r\n> If you'd like, you could add this as a topic of discussion at one of\
      \ the monthly CL meetings.\r\n\r\nIt would also be great to discuss this topic.\
      \ If you could let me know how to get added to the meeting and/or access the\
      \ meeting agenda, that would be great. Thanks!"
    - "> Please let me know if I should create a separate ticket.\r\n\r\n@jychien,\
      \ yes, kindly create a NTR issue including  cross-references.\r\n\r\n>  If you\

  comments:
  - why do you have changes in the `merged_import.owl`?
  - can revert them - happen the term to be obsolete has a uberon term in there, and
    so obsoletion in protege removes/change all axioms, one (or more) of which comes
    from import. I have opened another ticket for uberon already, so better way would
    probably be to let this be and make sure uberon side changes, gets imported into
    cl, before release - of course with the 2 weeks notification, this has got to
    be coordinated and all, so will leave that to you all. For now I will revert changes

      \ the major blood vessels to and from the medulla, and capillary loops that\
      \ enter the cortex from the medulla are also ensheathed by the type-1 cells.\"\
      \r\n\r\n- A reference found online, PMID:[18194204](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18194204),\
      \ states the following with respect to normal mouse thymus:\r\n\"\u2018Subcapsular\
      \ epithelial cells\u2019 (type 1) were positioned against the capsule, septa\
      \ and perivascular connective tissue, and always had a basal lamina. These cells\
      \ were found to be irregular in shape and showed cellular prolongations that\
      \ interconnected them with the adjacent epithelial cells by means of desmosomes.\
      \ The nucleus was found to be mostly euchromatic and the cytoplasm had a very\
      \ active appearance: the Golgi complex was well developed; smooth and coated\
      \ vesicles, multivesicular bodies and elongated profiles of rough endoplasmic\
      \ reticulum were abundant, whereas only a moderate number of mitochondria and\
      \ polyribosomes were seen. Fine bundles of keratin tonofilaments were positioned\
      \ around the nucleus and throughout the cytoplasm.\"\r\n\r\n-  @addiehl, if\
      \ you have more insight on thymic epithelial subtypes, please do advise.\r\n\
      \r\nGiven the above, I propose the following to address the immediate issue:\r\
      \n\r\n- [x] 'subcapsular thymic epithelial cell' can remain to serve as a general\
      \ class to group the heterogenous cells types in that region. No change.\r\n\
      \r\n- [x] The synonym \"subcapsular thymic epithelial cell\" of 'type-1 epithelial\
      \ cell of thymus' can be changed from an exact to a **related** synonym with\
      \ dbxrefs PMID:[18194204](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18194204) and PMID:[2694455](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2694455/).\
      \ In a separate issue, the text definition can be refined."

    - '@shawntanzk I could track back the addition of this axiom to [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/1713#issuecomment-1308668622).
      What are the reason for adding some amacrine cells as subclasses of horizontal
      cells? In the [publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662730080478X?via%3Dihub#BIB55)

    - I saw that comment, but in the owl file none of the amacrine cells are SubclassOf

  - '@aleixpuigb, can you point me to the reference that classifies this ''flag amacrine
    cell'' as a horizontal cell?'
  - This might be a problem inherited from another PR/merging the master branch to
    this one. Thank you for spotting it.
  - Did not find evidence to support text def in dbxrefs. (flag A and flag b amacrine
    cell types).
  - "In the dbxref I have provided:\r\n\r\n\"Taken together, these results support\
    \ Lgr5 as a specific marker of glycinergic ACs.\"\r\n\"We crossed Lgr5eGFP/CreER\
    \ mice with a Rosa26-loxP-STOP-loxP-dTomato reporter strain\"\r\n\"We observed\
    \ dTomato-positive cells in the form of small-field AC subtypes including AII,\
    \ Flag A, and Flag B, consistent with previous description of glycinergic ACs.\"\
    \r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's not all in one place, but split in different sentences\
    \ following the experiment."
  - I meant the first sentence of the definition.
  - The first sentence comes from [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/1606#issuecomment-1279416308).
    These cell types were imported with their definitions from the retinal CL. Shawn
    added dbxrefs for most of them, but probably he could not find for all of them.
  - "1- recommend to add (GABA) after gamma-aminobutyric acid to aid searching by\
    \ text/strings\r\n2- acetilcholine --> acetylcholine"
  - I can apply the same (for GABA) in all other GABAergic amacrine cells.

    - It's on my list to work on amacrine cells at some point. They need classification
      by NT and by dendrite field (narrow, medium and wide). Many amacrine cells in
      CL are Rabbit or Mouse specific, and their human homolog is missing. I
    - 'After some research I have prepared [a table that represents the amacrine cells
      in the different species](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ezEZ5Jx-LgNC9R8BYF0EgHWlYy0Aq67poMYO_HFrcRA/edit#gid=0).
      Amacrine cells can be classified in three groups : narrow field amacrine cells
      (glycinergic), medium field amacrine cells (GABAergic) and wide field amacrine
      cells (GABAergic). The majority of amacrine cells in CL come from [an article
      of 1998 in rabbits](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662730080478X?via%3Dihub).
      For some reason they were not classified (in the article they are, so that will
      be straightforward. Some name have changed in the last 25 years and will need
      to be revised. I can start addressing proper hierarchy, sorting by NT and dendritic
      field, and in separate tickets edit the existing cells and add the new ones
      (mainly human and non-human primates).'

  - Consider adding abbreviation tag to "BMSC".
  - Consider adding abbreviation tag to "I-2".
  - Consider adding abbreviation tag to "I-1".
  - Consider adding abbreviation tag to "L5b neuron".
  - In this case I was not sure if it was an abbreviation, as the label or the other
    sinonyms have nothing to do with it.
  - together with retinal ganglion cell A1, I will investigate them elsewhere. Both
    have as synonym Type I, and the related synonyms don't make sense.

    - "This has implications on our side - we can write our scripts around it either\

      \ as we are now referring to [obook docs](https://oboacademy.github.io/obook/reference/synonyms-obo/)\

    - "> we need to make sure this is well documented when the change happens \r\n\
      \r\nChanges are being documented in issues (like this one) and PRs, which will\
      \ also appear in release notes.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2363#issuecomment-1446928901\
      \ for outcomes of discussion, namely that abbreviations should be annotated\
      \ as related, not exact, synonyms. \r\nThis is still in line with the OBOOK\
      \ definitions. Whilst some abbreviations may have an exact meaning as the primary\
      \ term definition within the context of a particular reference, it may not hold\
      \ beyond that context or across other domains.\r\n\r\nAs abbreviations can be\
      \ used to represent anything, it was agreed that related was the most suitable\
      \ annotation type. As an example, \"LC\" is currently set as an exact synonym\
      \ of '[Langerhans cell](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000453)', but it\
      \ is planned to be changed to related with type 'abbreviation'. \"LC\" [is used\
      \ across domains to represent over 150 other entities/things](https://acronyms.thefreedictionary.com/LC).\
      \ \"LC\" potentially can be used as a synonym to annotate multiple OBO ontology\
      \ terms (can be non-unique), e.g., \"LC\" can represent 'Langerhans cell' and\
      \ 'locus ceruleus'. It was discussed and decided that an exact synonym can be\
      \ associated only with one term.\r\n\r\nCompare the example above to something\
      \ like \"aortic wall\" and \"wall of aorta\", which would hold the exact meaning\
      \ across any domain.\r\n\r\nIt was also discussed that annotating abbreviation\
      \ synonyms as related synonyms (and typing them as abbreviations) would yield\
      \ better results in NLP/ML training algorithms."
    - ">  Whilst some abbreviations may have an exact meaning as the primary term\
      \ definition within the context of a particular reference, it may not hold beyond\
      \ that context or across other domains.\r\n\r\nYou can say that of almost any\
      \ synonym.  Within specific references, the scope is clear. Outside of a specific\
      \ references, scope can only be set by  getting a general impression of use\
      \ in the literature, which often changes over time and may be domain specific.\
      \  Lots of examples from fly - optic lobe neuron  type names have changed in\
      \ meaning/usage over the past 15 years.; many difference in meaning of the same\
      \ terms between usage in Drosophila and more generally in insects."
    - I agree with Shawn that, whatever the policy, we should have well-publicised,
      general advice on use of synonyms scopes & types in search (& NLP) for CL.    Some
      ontologies have a lot of very tangentially related terms in the RELATED scope
      (IIRC, GO is very liberal), whereas others use it more strictly.   This is a
      major reason that OLS allows configuration of synonym scopes.  If RELATED synonyms
      work in search for OLS3, this will be due to the custom config for CL in OLS,
      which we can control.

      \ what else you would like to see to make these updates well publicised?\r\n\
      \r\nHere are a few places I think: \r\n\r\n1. Readme in CL Github Repo - most\
      \ important imo given thats where users that this would impact would go to\r\
      \n2. CL Editors guide (though note that a user, and not someone who edits the\
      \ ontology, would probably not bother going into editors guide, hence the first\
      \ one being important)\r\n3. IF this is to be implemented beyond CL and in OBO\
      \ ontologies (at least the ones the technical working group focus on (which\
      \ seems to be the focus of obook anyway) like CL, Uberon, PATO, RO) then maybe\
      \ obook (though ill admit this is selfish on my part as I tend to just share\
      \ obook links with colleagues when pointing them to stuff) \r\n4. CL website\
      \ perhaps (though I'd think the link to the github which is already there would\
      \ suffice) \r\n\r\nHope that helps and thanks heaps :) really appreciate it"

    like there have been some gains..
  - If so, it needs to change in ODK.

      \ basal cell that is part of the urothelium.\r\n**proposed**:  A basal cell\
      \ that is part of the urothelium. Compared to other urothelial cell types, a\
      \ basal cell of the urothelium is positioned along the basement membrane, is\
      \ the most undifferentiated and serves a progenitor role. (doi:10.1038/s41385-022-00565-0)\r\
      \n- [x] add comment:\r\nIt has been noted in at least some mammalian species\
      \ that the urothelial basal cell type is distinguished by expression of high\
      \ levels of cytokeratin-5 (CK5), p63 and the signalling molecule Sonic hedgehog\
      \ (Shh). Similar to intermediate cells, the urothelial basal cell type expresses\
      \ CK17 but is negative for uroplakins (UPK) and CK20. Urothelial basal cells\
      \ have also been noted to be smaller in diameter than urothelial intermediate\
      \ cells.\r\n(doi:10.1038/s41385-022-00565-0)\r\n\r\nfyi @jenjou \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  comments:
  - The annotation should be `has synonym type`, and not `Synonym type property`.
  - This article indicates that [granule cells of ICj project to allocortical structures
    such as the septum, piriform cortex and amygdala](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/cne.901810209).
    Therefore, I would use `has soma location`, instead of `part of`.
  - Thanks for catching that. Assume you mean `has synonym type`.

      \ medium spiny neurons located outside of the D1-exclusive island and in Islands\
      \ of Calleja. Kappa-opioid receptor gene (_OPRK1_) has been noted to be absent\
      \ from D1-NUDAP cells. Many striosome-specific markers have been noted to be\
      \ upregulated in D1-NUDAP cells, including _KCNIP1_, _KCNT1_, _KHDRBS3_, and\
      \ _BACH2_. _PDYN_, an acknowledged D1-striosome marker gene, has also been noted\
      \ to be expressed in D1-NUDAPs. D1-NUDAPs also express some genes found to be\
      \ selectively expressed in the matrix, including _STXBP6_, _GDA_, and _SEMA3E_.\
      \ Gene enrichment analysis has revealed that D1-NUDAP neurons express genes\
      \ that have been implicated in drug addiction and many other functions.\r\n\

    - CC @jeremymiller  - do you have time to look over these?  Thanks!
    - It looks okay, but Nelson Johansen would be a better person to confirm.
    - CC @UCDNJJ - would you be able to review these terms for us.  Thanks!

    Also `urothellial` -> `urothelial`."
  - "Thank you for spotting both.\r\nI've noticed Prot\xE9g\xE9 will sometimes default\
    \ to rdfs:comment. Thank you for catching."
  - "And coming back to an earlier discussion: In this case, should it be \u201CA**n**\
    \ urothelial cell\u201D or \u201CA urothelial cell\u201D? (Genuine question; I\u2019\

  - In this instance it should be "A" since "urothelial" starts with a consonant sound,
    like "urine" or "university".

    - "Why is this change needed?\r\n\r\nThe current logical definition provides a\
      \ precise location and is sufficient for autoclassification. The proposed change\
      \ does breaks both of these."
    - "Ahh - think I now understand.  Aim is to infer correct classification of  'urothelial\
      \ cell of trigone of urinary bladder\u2019.  But isn't this part of the urothelium\
      \ of the trigone?  Could be fixed by either extending Uberon to add term for\
      \ this, or by anonymously referring to it in the logical def \r\n\r\n'urothelial\
      \ cell of trigone of urinary bladder\u2019 EquivalentTo 'urothelial cell' and\
      \ part_of some (urothelium and part of some 'trigone of urinary bladder')\r\n\
      \r\nIf you do this, then I would recommend the following fixes:\r\n\r\n\r\n\
      - [ ] **Add text definition:**\r\n\"A urothellial cell that is part of the urothelium\
      \ of the urinary bladder.\"\r\ndoi:10.1038/s41385-022-00565-0\r\n\r\n\r\n- **retain\

  comments:
  - Should `DOI:` be `doi:` ?
  - "I've seen both in CL.\r\n[Line 84 in this PR](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/2010/files)\
    \ for editor guidance shows \"doi:\". \r\n\r\n@dosumis, is there a preference?\r\
    \n\r\nCan we merge this PR and address in a separate issue dedicated to annotation\
    \ standards?"
  - "Looks like Nico has already given [actionable advice ](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/2013#issuecomment-1582512130)\
    \ in the new ticket you made. Up to you where you fix CURIEs and doc as long as\
    \ we end up conforming to the latest standard. \r\n\r\n@gouttegd - if updates\
    \ to curies in FBbt are required (or have already happened), we will need to co-ord\
    \ with VFB to ensure nothing breaks."
  - Cross-references to DOIs in FBbt use `doi:` (lowercase) exclusively, not `DOI:`.
    This is [the recommendation of the DOI specification](https://www.doi.org/the-identifier/resources/handbook/2_numbering#2.6.1).

      \ described as having characteristics similar to a novel medium spiny neuron\
      \ described in rodents (D1H or eccentric spiny projection neuron). Although\
      \ an extrastriosomal cell type, the D1/2 cell type had been noted to express\

  - After cursory review, did not find the term "follicle stem cell" mentioned in
    the dbxrefs.
  - '"somatic stem cell" may be more appropriate as a parent class than broad synonym.
    Was this meant to be "escort stem cell"?'

    ll add another paper that refers to \u201Cfollicle stem cells\u201D."
  - "Currently \u201Csomatic stem cell\u201C is a subclass of [epithelial fate stem\
    \ cell](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000036), which is correct and more\
    \ precise than [somatic stem cell](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000723),\
    \ which is higher up in the hierarchy.\r\n\r\nThe synonym is there because \u201C\
    somatic stem cell\u201D is frequently used to refer to these cells, but that name\
    \ is precise enough _only_ when it is used in the context of the insect ovary,\
    \ where it is used in opposition to \u201Cgermline stem cells\u201D (the other\
    \ type of stem cells in the ovary).\r\n\r\nThe \u201Cescort stem cells\u201D mentioned\

      \ during the \u201Cfirst neurogenesis\u201D and neurons born during the \u201C\
      second neurogenesis\u201D \u2014 _if_ that is indeed the meaning that was intended\

      \ of zebrafish (the FZA term has a cross-reference back to the CL term). In\
      \ ZFA, [primary motor neurons](https://zfin.org/action/ontology/term-detail/ZFA:0009244)\

      \ neurons that \u201Cdevelop several hours later than primary motor neurons\u201D\

      \ of the primary motor cortex\u201D, and likewise _secondary motor neuron_ could\
      \ be \u201Ca neuron of the secondary motor areas\u201D. Of note, both _primary\

    - "Primary and secondary neurons\r\nTwo populations of neurons, primary and secondary,\r\
      \nhave been described in the spinal cord and hindbrain of\r\nlower vertebrates\
      \ (Coghill, 1913; Forehand and Farel,\r\n1982; Roberts and Clarke, 1982; Fetcho,\
      \ 1987). Primary\r\nneurons are characterised by their small number, early\r\
      \ndevelopment, characteristic location and large size.\r\nThey generally pioneer\
      \ axon tracts (see Myers et al.\r\n1986) and are believed to be responsible\
      \ for establishing\r\nthe first functional circuits within the nervous system\r\
      \n(Sillar and Roberts, 1980). Secondary neurons develop\r\nlater and are produced\
      \ in far greater numbers (Myers,\r\n1985; Myers etal. 1986). It is possible\
      \ that the relatively\r\nfew neurons with long axons described at 1 day are\r\
      \nprimary, but they must be characterised further to see if\r\nthey meet the\
      \ criteria suggested for primary neurons in\r\nother regions of the zebrafish\
      \ nervous system (Grun-\r\nwald et al. 1988). Along this line, the genetic mutation\r\
      \nthat spares primary neurons in zebrafish does not spare\r\nany retinal neurons,\
      \ implying that none of them are\r\nprimary (Grunwald et al. 1988). This is\
      \ consistent with\r\nthe results of this study, in which we have shown that\r\
      \nretinal axons do not pioneer their pathway, but follow a\r\npre-existing tract.\

    - Objection to obsoleting these cell terms.  They are the commonly studied neuron
      types in the developing zebrafish embryos.
    - The consensus of the meeting was that such terms do not belong in CL. People
      needing them can use the ZFA terms (for zebrafish) or the FBbt terms (for flies).
    - 'The ZFA terms are the zebrafish instance of the CL term.   The first mention
      on Github of any problem with the term was only last week.  The meeting was
      one week later.  CL was originally unifying the cell components of the various
      species specific ontologies similar to how UBERON works for gross anatomy.    If
      CL is acting as the source for all cells then sufficient time should be given
      to allow the community to review proposals and come up with definitions.     One
      week notice is not sufficient for terms to be made obsolete.  '

    - "@aleixpuigb @dosumis \r\nTo be honest, I think it makes the most sense to start\
      \ by looking at the current hierarchy of CL at tree level and it becomes really\
      \ obvious what doesn't make sense, then figure out at what level you want to\
      \ hit and the hard part is to figure out how computationally you can retrieve\
      \ the same list!\r\nIt's most natural to biologist to think in terms of histology\
      \ to distinguish tissues and the cells that you can observe from various antibody\
      \ based imaging methods.\r\nSome thought of using the embryonic layer origins\
      \ as a starting place: \r\nThe three germ layers are the endoderm, the ectoderm,\
      \ and the mesoderm. (This has been discussed before and some loose categorization\
      \ based on this in CL).\r\n**Upper cell types should match the tissue / histology\
      \ level types:**\r\n4 types high level: 1) connective 2) epithelial, 3) muscle\
      \ 4) nervous\r\n**Each of those can be broken down further:**\r\n7 Connective\
      \ tissues: \r\n1) cartilage 2) bone (osseus), 3) blood, 4) adipose (fat), 5)\
      \ loose connective tissue 6) dense fibrous connectve tissue 7) elastic connective\
      \ tissue\r\n3 muscle tissue types: \r\n1) striated = a) skeletal (voluntary)\
      \ or b) cardiac) , c smooth muscle\r\n6 Epithelial tissue types: \r\nThe number\
      \ of cell layers and cell types together give rise to 6 different types of epithelial\
      \ tissue.\r\nSimple squamous epithelia.\r\nSimple cuboidal epithelia.\r\nSimple\
      \ columnar epithelia.\r\nStratified squamous epithelia.\r\nStratified cuboidal\
      \ epithelia.\r\nStratified columnar epithelia.\r\nPlus endothelium and mesothelium\
      \ \r\n\r\nAlso I was looking at other categories of cell types and wonder if\
      \ some  are redundant or not useful. For instance categorizing on number of\
      \ nuclei is okay but by far the majority of all cells are single nucleate but\
      \ all single nucleate cell types are not listed under it. The real minority\
      \ cells are multi nucleate. All of this is mostly categorizing white blood cell\
      \ types or could be muscle cell types. Not useful for most other cell types.\r\
      \nSimilar vein is categorizing on haploid, diploid or polyploid. I think these\
      \ are covered by the nature of the cell type itself and the vast majority are\
      \ diploid.\r\nYet you don\u2019t see all diploid cells under diploid.\r\nFor\
      \ epithelial tissue types there are more actually that you learn in histology\
      \ course like transitional epithelium (found in urinary bladder.  I just pulled\
      \ done quick stuff out as examples."
    - "This seems reasonable as a starting point for coverage: \r\n\r\ncartilage 2)\
      \ bone (osseus), 3) blood, 4) adipose (fat), 5) loose connective tissue 6) dense\
      \ fibrous connectve tissue 7) elastic connective tissue\r\n3 muscle tissue types:\r\
      \nstriated = a) skeletal (voluntary) or b) cardiac) , c smooth muscle\r\n+ eptihelial\
      \ cell\r\n+ immune cells\r\n- but I'm sure this won't cover enough of the ontology\
      \ - so maybe start here and extend with other grouping types until coverage\
      \ is sufficient.\r\n"

  - The reason is that those hallmarks are specific for a subset of CD8 lung TRM that

    not focus on a subset.

  - The two sentences after the first may be applicable to all resident memory T cells,
    not specifically to lung-resident memory T cells.
  - I will remove it, as it is confusing, thank you!
  - If using "cells" in the synonym, this would be a related synonym with type "plural".
  - CD69 and CXCR6 may not be specific to lung tissue, but rather any tissue-resident
    T cell so stating "which regulates the localization in the lung" may be misleading.

      \ and _secondary_ here.\r\n\r\nIn FBbt, _primary neuron_ and _secondary neuron_\
      \ have a clear meaning: a primary neuron is a neuron that arises during the\
      \ first wave of neurogenesis (at the embryonic stage), while a secondary neuron\
      \ is a neuron that arises during the second wave of neurogenesis (at the larval\
      \ stage).\r\n\r\nThe concept of \u201Ctwo-stages neurogenesis\u201D is not specific\
      \ to flies, so it makes sense for CL to have terms referring to neurons born\
      \ during the \u201Cfirst neurogenesis\u201D and neurons born during the \u201C\
      second neurogenesis\u201D \u2014 _if_ that is indeed the meaning that was intended\
      \ when the above terms were added in CL.\r\n\r\n[primary motor neuron](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000533)\
      \ is a parent to [CAP motoneuron](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0000532),\
      \ which again has no definition but is probably the [CaP motoneuron](https://zfin.org/action/ontology/term-detail/ZFA:0009243)\
      \ of zebrafish (the FZA term has a cross-reference back to the CL term). In\
      \ ZFA, [primary motor neurons](https://zfin.org/action/ontology/term-detail/ZFA:0009244)\
      \ are neurons that arise during the first day of development, while [secondary\
      \ motor neurons](https://zfin.org/action/ontology/term-detail/ZFA:0009247) are\
      \ neurons that \u201Cdevelop several hours later than primary motor neurons\u201D\
      , which at first sight seems compatible with the general idea that \u201Cprimary\u201C\
      \ and \u201Csecondary\u201D refer to the _time_ at which the neurons appear.\r\
      \n\r\nOn the other hand, _primary motor neuron_ could also easily be understood\
      \ (especially by people with a \u201Cvertebrate mindset\u201D) as \u201Ca neuron\
      \ of the primary motor cortex\u201D, and likewise _secondary motor neuron_ could\
      \ be \u201Ca neuron of the secondary motor areas\u201D. Of note, both _primary\
      \ motor neuron_ and _secondary motor neuron_ are mapped to equivalent FMA terms\
      \ ([FMA:83619](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_83619) and [FMA:83620](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_83619),\
      \ respectively), but since the FMA terms _also_ have no definitions (\U0001F629\
      ), that does not help a bit\u2026\r\n\r\nSo:\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know or remember\
      \ what was the intended meaning of _primary_ and _secondary_ in the label of\
      \ the terms above? Was it about timing (where \u201Cprimary\u201D \u2248 \u201C\
      early\u201D and \u201Csecondary\u201D \u2248 \u201Clate\u201D), as in flies\

    - 'Decision from the CL meeting of April 19th 2023: No agreement on what the meaning
      should be. Those terms should be obsoleted instead of being defined.'
    - "Primary and secondary neurons\r\nTwo populations of neurons, primary and secondary,\r\
      \nhave been described in the spinal cord and hindbrain of\r\nlower vertebrates\
      \ (Coghill, 1913; Forehand and Farel,\r\n1982; Roberts and Clarke, 1982; Fetcho,\
      \ 1987). Primary\r\nneurons are characterised by their small number, early\r\
      \ndevelopment, characteristic location and large size.\r\nThey generally pioneer\
      \ axon tracts (see Myers et al.\r\n1986) and are believed to be responsible\
      \ for establishing\r\nthe first functional circuits within the nervous system\r\
      \n(Sillar and Roberts, 1980). Secondary neurons develop\r\nlater and are produced\
      \ in far greater numbers (Myers,\r\n1985; Myers etal. 1986). It is possible\
      \ that the relatively\r\nfew neurons with long axons described at 1 day are\r\
      \nprimary, but they must be characterised further to see if\r\nthey meet the\
      \ criteria suggested for primary neurons in\r\nother regions of the zebrafish\
      \ nervous system (Grun-\r\nwald et al. 1988). Along this line, the genetic mutation\r\
      \nthat spares primary neurons in zebrafish does not spare\r\nany retinal neurons,\
      \ implying that none of them are\r\nprimary (Grunwald et al. 1988). This is\
      \ consistent with\r\nthe results of this study, in which we have shown that\r\
      \nretinal axons do not pioneer their pathway, but follow a\r\npre-existing tract.\

    - Objection to obsoleting these cell terms.  They are the commonly studied neuron
      types in the developing zebrafish embryos.
    - The consensus of the meeting was that such terms do not belong in CL. People
      needing them can use the ZFA terms (for zebrafish) or the FBbt terms (for flies).
    - 'The ZFA terms are the zebrafish instance of the CL term.   The first mention
      on Github of any problem with the term was only last week.  The meeting was
      one week later.  CL was originally unifying the cell components of the various
      species specific ontologies similar to how UBERON works for gross anatomy.    If
      CL is acting as the source for all cells then sufficient time should be given
      to allow the community to review proposals and come up with definitions.     One
      week notice is not sufficient for terms to be made obsolete.  '

    - I suspect that they were all added by Michael to some of the earliest versions
      of CL and were taken directly from FBbt prior to me adding definitions in FBbt.  If
      we keep them in CL, then they will need suitably general definitions.  Pan insect
      defs are probably relatively easy.  Pan arthropod possible in some cases.  Protostomes
      generally or ecdysozoa (includes arhtropods and nemotodes) likely very challenging.

    be species-agnostic, i.e., they should apply to any (metazoan) species. As it
    is, a club cell in the bronchus of a murine lung would not be covered by this
    logical definition.

  - the two first terms look like a wrong usage of the abbreviation, as it reads as
    `diffuse bipolar cell type diffuse bipolar 1` and `diffuse bipolar 1 bipolar cell`.
    I would like to avoid adding these half abbreviations in the ontology.

  - I have removed the comment, thank you.
  - Thank you, added in the comment.
  - I agree that a cell type only described by cell expression is insufficient. However,
    these cells being specific to the fovea is a hypothesis due the lack of expression
    of the genes in the periphery, but does not respond to any histological observation
  - Thank you for the suggestion. I have added the new term and had db3a and db3b

  - After a cursory review, I found DB3a and DB3b mentioned in [PMID:32555229](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32555229),
    but not this general class.
  - Although apparently derived from the abbreviation of "diffuse bipolar", DB# seems
    to be used as a descriptor/adjective across many of the references in this PR
    and not strictly as abbreviations.
  - Recommend replacing the word "preferential". Same as above.
  - '"has a predominant connectivity" --> "predominantly connects to"'

      on properties might be more straightforward. Maybe add to agenda for CL@EBI?

      it was tailored for one of our project. As far as I understand, aim is to have
      80-90 % coverage with the slim list.

  comments:
  - The first sentence reads like a definition and there is otherwise currently no
    text definition annotated on this class. Unsure if this is intended.
  - Recommend adding synonym type abbreviation where appropriate.
  - Thank you, I will apply this comment for the rest of the terms
  - It is an honest mistake, thank you for spotting it.
  - Based on cursory review of the references, unsure if this is accurate as this
    cell type seems to be present before the formation of alveoli and described to
    be part of the "secondary crest" or septa. They are also described to be part
    of the mesenchyme/interstitium, which I think would be considered distinct from
    alveoli.
  - Did not find reference to this cell type in PMID:31651362... seems to reference
    this cell type in the bronchi instead.
  - Is this necessary given the equivalence axiom?
  - Is this necessary given the equivalence axiom?
  - Did not find reference to this cell type in PMID:31651362... seems to reference
    this cell type in the bronchi instead.
  - After cursory review, did not find this cell type mentioned in PMID:31651362.
  - Will be inferred based on equivalence axiom.
  - Unsure if there is a specific reason "lung" is used here and "airway" used in
    other terms. Ref describes "PC-fibro around the airway cartilage".
  - It is very tricky, because it is present before the formation of the septa/second
    crest (it initiates their formation). I agree that it is present before the alveolar
    stage (saccular stage). Therefore, `'part of' some 'lung connective tissue'` and
    `'participates in' some 'lung alveolus development'` are more appropriate opiate.
  - No, thank you.
  - No, thank you.
  - 'Thank you for your comment, @bvarner-ebi. Initially I was considering airway
    for this same reason, however in the text you are quoting it is describing the
    localisation of PC-fibro in an image showing an airway. That doesn''t exclude
    that it is also present in other pulmonary parts, as this cell is "enriched in
    the airways", but that doesn''t mean it is exclusive, as cartilage it is not exclusive
    around the airways: "[Cartilage (hyaline type) has the function of maintaining
    airway patency and it also serves for the attachment of local muscle and connective
    tissue.](https://www.intechopen.com/chapters/57030)"'

  - "During the maturation of the septa, secondary crest myofibroblasts, together\
    \ with matrix fibroblasts, **secretes** metalloproteinases\r\n-->\r\nDuring the\
    \ maturation of the septa, secondary crest myofibroblasts, together with matrix\
    \ fibroblasts, **secrete** metalloproteinases"
  - Was the deletion of CL:4033019 intentional?
  - yes, 'serous secreting cell of trachea gland' will no longer be a new term as
    this cell type exists as CL:1000330 "serous cell of epithelium of trachea". All
    serous cells in airways are found in submucosal gland. Therefore, a separate ticket
    will be issued to update names, textual definitions and logical definitions for
    serous cells.
  - Thank you, just saw your previous comment confirming this was intended.
  - If this cell type does exist in lung tissue, would you please add that reference
    to the term. The quote mentioned above refers to the airways as well.
  - "Looking at the [scRNA-seq data](https://5locationslung.cellgeni.sanger.ac.uk/all),\
    \ the majority of cells identified as PC-fibro came from airway tissue, but a\
    \ small proportion (~0'4%) was found in parenchymal tissue:\r\n<img width=\"250\"\
    \ alt=\"image\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94959119/226394017-e2f96653-2df1-4c50-b95e-c867584cdc95.png\"\
    >\r\nOf course the number of cells is very small and they can be false positives\
    \ (in the umap they don't map with the PC-fibro cluster) or a different kind of\
    \ perichondrial cells. In the later case, it makes more sense to use 'lung perichondrial\
    \ fibroblast' to encompass all PC-fibro found in the lung.\r\n"
  - If that is from the dbxref, and if Par stands for parenchyma, it seems reasonable.

    - I agree with @balhoff. It's better and easier to replace all properties with
      numeric identifiers.
    - Proposal is to use CL IDs for these.  I think this is a reasonable solution.

    - Just 1 CHEBI term used in all of CL? Lets get rid of it!
    - Can I replace it with [GO:0006582](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/cl/classes/http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FGO_0006582)?
    - Needs @dosumis I dont know
    - I can't think of any other way to formalise.  Could just remove the EC axiom.  Wouldn't
      be too much of a loss I think.
    - '- [ ] ok. Let us add ObjectSomeValuesFrom(obo:BFO_0000050 obo:UBERON_0002097)

  - This seems reasonable if the synonyms are also removed and 'lobular bronchiole'
    becomes a new Uberon class.
  - 'I don''t think annotated synonyms impact inferences. '

    \ x is part of y and x is connected directly or indirectly to the main stem of\
    \ y\r\n\r\nA bronchiole is not part of a bronchus (they are separate), so I don't\
    \ think that property is correctly applied in this case. Asserting that a bronchiole\
    \ is a 'branching part of' a 'tracheobronchial tree' seems more appropriate."
  - '''brush cell of lobular bronchiole'' should be `''brush cell'' and (''part of''
    some ''epithelium of lobular bronchiole'')`. However, as ''epithelium of lobular
    bronchiole'' is an exact synonym of ''epithelium of bronchiole'', it is inferred
    that ''brush cell of terminal bronchiole'' is a subclass of ''brush cell of lobular
    bronchiole'''

    comments:
    - "Hi @emquardokus, following up on this ticket. \r\nThere has been discussion\
      \ in the linked PR about this newly requested cell type versus the already existing\
      \ CL term [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576).\r\
      \n\r\nHere are my findings:\r\n- [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576)\
      \ uses a wiki link as a dbxref.\r\n- In that dbxref, the term \"perineural cell\"\
      \ (with no \"i\") is **not** found. Only 'perineurial cell' appears in the wiki\
      \ page.\r\n- The current text definition of [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576)\
      \ is somewhat aligned with the dbxref... it however restricts the cell type\
      \ to the spinal cord, which is not supported by the dbxref. Perhaps the editor\
      \ meant to write \"spinal nerve\". \r\n- The current equivalence axiom of [CL:0002576\
      \ 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576) aligns with\
      \ the dbxref:\r\n```\r\n'myofibroblast cell'\r\n and ('part of' some perineurium)\r\
      \n```\r\nAlthough, there is no reference in the wikipedia page to support the\
      \ \"myofibroblast\" claim. The assertion in the wiki page that these cells are\
      \ fibroblasts also seems contested (see [PMID:25818566](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25818566)).\r\
      \n- Referring to the NCIT reference in this ticket, NCIT has a parent category\
      \ of \"perineural cell\", under which \"perineurial cell\" is a child. The NCIT\
      \ text definition of \"perineural cell\" is \"A cell surrounding a neuron\"\
      .\r\n\r\nGiven the above, here are my conclusions:\r\n- It appears that \"perineural\
      \ cell\" describes any cell type surrounding a neuron, whereas \"perineurial\
      \ cell\" describes a cell that is specifically located in the [perineurium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000121).\r\
      \n- The existing CL term likely is meant to represent a 'perineurial cell, but\
      \ **has an incorrect label** and partially inaccurate defintions. Upon cursory\
      \ searches, there is no \"perineural cell\" type that matches the current CL\
      \ definitions.\r\n- The cell type requested in this ticket is likely the same\
      \ as [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576).\
      \ It seems both terms refer to the cell type indicated below (PMID:25818566):\r\
      \n\r\n<img width=\"741\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 12 25 18\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95643797/211310314-ab067e67-c479-40f8-976e-ea233c75c7e6.png\"\
      >\r\n\r\nIf there is consensus on the above, here is my proposal.\r\n\r\nProposed\
      \ next steps:\r\n- Do not create a new term for this request, as the concept\
      \ already exists in CL as [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576).\r\
      \n- Update the current label for CL:0002576 to 'perneurial cell'.\r\n- Revise\
      \ EA to `'glial cell' and 'part of' some perineurium`. **UPDATE**: Given the\
      \ question if whether this cell type is  possibly a fibroblast and/or myofibroblast,\
      \ remove EA and add 'glial cell' and 'part of' some perineurium` as superclasses.\r\
      \n- Replace the current text definition for CL:0002576 with the one above in\
      \ the original request.\r\n- Add another dbxref to support the definition provided\
      \ (consider PMID:25818566).\r\n- Add exact synonym \"perineurial glial cell\"\
      \ (PMID: [25818566](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25818566)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
    - "@emquardokus provided review article [PMID:36244793](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36244793/),\
      \ which states:\r\n\r\n\"Previous studies\u2014including this one\u2014 largely\

  - "Consider removing \"secretory\" from definition.\r\nFrom PMID:22911892:\r\n\"\
    These small, narrow cells have been described historically as non-functioning\
    \ secretory cells that could possibly be the precursor of the secretory cell [[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4442093/#R5)];\
    \ however, their role and function was not investigated.\""
  - Consider removing, unless you add evidence that this cell functions as a 'secretory
    cell' as it is defined in CL.
  - Is there evidence to support this assertion?
  - It is not a secretory cell, so I have removed it. The literature that was considering
    them secretory is outdated
  - "Isn't this definitional?  'fallopian tube epithelium' = 'oviduct epithelium'\
    \ in Uberon.  This seems reasonable given: \r\n\r\n<img width=\"656\" alt=\"image\"\

    \ of the female reproductive system. \r\n\r\n- [x] TODO Add Uberon ticket on this.\
    \ Might be complicated due to cross-species nature of ontology."
  - "Some notes on text definition:\r\n- The first sentence may describe other cell\
    \ types (e.g., 'fallopian tube secretory epithelial cell').\r\n\r\n- PMID:22911892\
    \ seems to only investigate the fallopian tube epithelium as opposed to whole\
    \ oviduct. Is there a reference (other than BTO) that reports this cell in other\
    \ locations of the oviduct?\r\n\r\n- Since the name of this cell type (and the\
    \ synonym) are based on morphological and positional features, consider noting\
    \ this (small size, little cytoplasm, basally located, \"found intercalated between\
    \ the adjacent ciliated and secretory cells\", etc.)\r\n\r\n- In last sentence,\
    \ capitalise letter of first word."
  - As noted above, PMID:22911892 seems to only investigate the fallopian tube epithelium
    as opposed to whole oviduct. Is there a reference (other than BTO) that reports
    this cell in other locations of the oviduct?
  - "Consider adding exact synonyms:\r\nfallopian tube epithelial stem-like cell\r\

  - Thank you for the suggestions!
  - Consider adding has_synonym_type "abbreviation". Can refer to CL:4030035 'dental
    pulp stem cell' for an example.
  - "Consider using singular form to refer to cell type throughout definition. \r\n\
    E.g., \"These cells are...\" --> \"This cell type is...\", etc."
  - "The dbxref focuses on the fallopian tube. If this cell type is restricted to\
    \ humans, this axiom seems OK since \"mammalian oviduct\" is an exact synonym.\
    \ But note, Uberon partly defines the fallopian tube as a subdivision of the oviduct.\
    \ \r\n\r\nAlso consider that neighbouring cell types invoked in the text definition\
    \ ('fallopian tube secretory epithelial cell' and 'fallopian tube ciliated cell')\
    \ include the axiom 'part of' some 'fallopian tube'."
  - Peg cells are not restricted in humans and there are some [references](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30023181/)
    about it. However, the literature research has focused in humans. Therefore I
    could create "peg cell" and "fallopian tube peg cell" terms independently, but
    that is not very practical. It is a bit messier because in humans the oviduct
    receive a different names (fallopian tube), but creating two terms we are duplicating
    them. The main problem comes with the synonyms, as they refer to fallopian tubes,
    so they are only exact synonyms in humans, so probably a narrow synonym (or even
    broad) would be more appropriate.
  - "Consider this text definition to address the oviduct/fallopian tube complication:\r\

  - I believe it is more accurate to label this cell type 'direct pathway medium spiny
    neuron' since "direct" describes the pathway in which the neurone is located and
    not a property of the neurone itself. Additionally 'direct pathway medium spiny
    medium neuron' is what is used in the references provided.
  - I believe it is more accurate to label this cell type 'indirect pathway medium
    spiny neuron' since "indirect" describes the pathway in which the neurone is located
    and not a property of the neurone itself. Additionally 'indirect pathway medium
    spiny medium neuron' is what is used in the references provided.
  - will change it and make the current label a synonym

  - This is a synonym for indirect pathway MSN.
  - This is a synonym for indirect pathway MSN.
  - This is a synonym for direct pathway MSN.
  - Actually do not see this synonym in the dbxref.
  - Don't see this synonym in provided dbxref and probably meant for direct pathway
    MSN.
  - 'Unnecessary abbreviation in definition: "GPe"'
  - argh sorry, did the correct subclass but somehow messed up the synonym >.<
  - its spelling out the short form that they used - my thinking being that some people
    might search using full name and all
  - "Since this synonym (in a spelled out form) does not appear in the reference,\
    \ consider removing it and/or the dbxref. If a user searches \"dopamine 1 medium\
    \ spiny neuron\", the class will still appear in Prot\xE9g\xE9 without this synonym\
    \ present."
  - Same issue as noted [here](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/1752/files#r1048209727).
  - May be an upstream modelling issue, but is there evidence D1A receptors are expressed
    (versus any D1 receptor)? Uberon shows D1 receptor and D1A receptors as exact
    synonyms... unsure if that is accurate.
  - 'It is accurate according to PR ontology definition (translation of DRD1) where
    it is imported from - DRD1 encodes for dopamine 1 receptors. I think the modelling
    is right as it groups D1-like together (which includes DRD5). Took me a second
    look when I was adding that too and I studied dopamine receptors for my PhD >.<
    2 years and everything is forgotten lol '
  - 'agree, ill remove the dbxref. I''d still rather keep the synonym in as I think
    it is useful. '

    - '@dosumis - question: do we REALLY need http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_4023070
      (''caudal ganglionic eminence derived GABAergic cortical interneuron'') to be
      cortical specific? Currently there''s a need to add CGE interneuron, and if
      I do, it CGE cortical interneuron will be the only child (unless I also created
      like hippocampus, amygdala etc. CGE interneuron. I don''t see a huge use case
      for the proliferation of these terms as we tend to also annotate location of
      cell types (eg annotating cell type as "CGE interneuron" and location as "hippocampus").
      Should we make a change for CGE and MGE to be wider brain applicable? If so
      should it be an obsolete and remake term (given we are changing the definition
      of the term)? Thanks'

    - "Hi @emquardokus, following up on this ticket. \r\nThere has been discussion\
      \ in the linked PR about this newly requested cell type versus the already existing\
      \ CL term [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576).\r\
      \n\r\nHere are my findings:\r\n- [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576)\
      \ uses a wiki link as a dbxref.\r\n- In that dbxref, the term \"perineural cell\"\
      \ (with no \"i\") is **not** found. Only 'perineurial cell' appears in the wiki\
      \ page.\r\n- The current text definition of [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576)\
      \ is somewhat aligned with the dbxref... it however restricts the cell type\
      \ to the spinal cord, which is not supported by the dbxref. Perhaps the editor\
      \ meant to write \"spinal nerve\". \r\n- The current equivalence axiom of [CL:0002576\
      \ 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576) aligns with\
      \ the dbxref:\r\n```\r\n'myofibroblast cell'\r\n and ('part of' some perineurium)\r\
      \n```\r\nAlthough, there is no reference in the wikipedia page to support the\
      \ \"myofibroblast\" claim. The assertion in the wiki page that these cells are\
      \ fibroblasts also seems contested (see [PMID:25818566](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25818566)).\r\
      \n- Referring to the NCIT reference in this ticket, NCIT has a parent category\
      \ of \"perineural cell\", under which \"perineurial cell\" is a child. The NCIT\
      \ text definition of \"perineural cell\" is \"A cell surrounding a neuron\"\
      .\r\n\r\nGiven the above, here are my conclusions:\r\n- It appears that \"perineural\
      \ cell\" describes any cell type surrounding a neuron, whereas \"perineurial\
      \ cell\" describes a cell that is specifically located in the [perineurium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000121).\r\
      \n- The existing CL term likely is meant to represent a 'perineurial cell, but\
      \ **has an incorrect label** and partially inaccurate defintions. Upon cursory\
      \ searches, there is no \"perineural cell\" type that matches the current CL\
      \ definitions.\r\n- The cell type requested in this ticket is likely the same\
      \ as [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576).\
      \ It seems both terms refer to the cell type indicated below (PMID:25818566):\r\
      \n\r\n<img width=\"741\" alt=\"Screenshot 2023-01-09 at 12 25 18\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95643797/211310314-ab067e67-c479-40f8-976e-ea233c75c7e6.png\"\
      >\r\n\r\nIf there is consensus on the above, here is my proposal.\r\n\r\nProposed\
      \ next steps:\r\n- Do not create a new term for this request, as the concept\
      \ already exists in CL as [CL:0002576 'perineural cell'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002576).\r\
      \n- Update the current label for CL:0002576 to 'perneurial cell'.\r\n- Revise\
      \ EA to `'glial cell' and 'part of' some perineurium`. **UPDATE**: Given the\
      \ question if whether this cell type is  possibly a fibroblast and/or myofibroblast,\
      \ remove EA and add 'glial cell' and 'part of' some perineurium` as superclasses.\r\
      \n- Replace the current text definition for CL:0002576 with the one above in\
      \ the original request.\r\n- Add another dbxref to support the definition provided\
      \ (consider PMID:25818566).\r\n- Add exact synonym \"perineurial glial cell\"\
      \ (PMID: [25818566](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25818566)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
    - "@emquardokus provided review article [PMID:36244793](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36244793/),\
      \ which states:\r\n\r\n\"Previous studies\u2014including this one\u2014 largely\
      \ accept the idea that the perineurial cell is a modified fibroblast with myofibroblastic\
      \ features (Bunge et al. 1989; Vega et al. 1996; Du Plessis et al. 1997).\"\r\
      \n\r\nI do not think this justifies the EA:\r\n\r\n```\r\n 'myofibroblast cell'\r\
      \n and ('part of' some perineurium)\r\n```\r\nLooking forward to additional\
      \ input on this and the proposed next steps above."

      \ it if we include the equivalence axiom\r\nlymphocyte and 'part of' some blood\r\
      \n\r\nThis way, the reasoner will infer 'peripheral blood lymphocyte' to be\

    - "Thank you for the new term request, @kalpanaps and for the feedback, @addiehl.\r\
      \n\r\nAfter skimming the reference, I am not sure if the text definition is\
      \ appropriate since it seems to refer to specific cell types that were arbitrarily\
      \ highlighted in the study. Could there be other subsets that are 'peripheral\
      \ blood lymphocytes' that are not mentioned in this text definition? @kalpanaps,\
      \ can you confirm or advise if I am misunderstanding?\r\n\r\n@addiehl, would\
      \ this EA also capture lymphocytes that are in blood but not part of acral /\
      \ peripheral circulation? It seems like 'blood' is not clearly distinguished\
      \ from 'peripheral blood' (the latter being a class that does not exist) in\
      \ the ontology. Is that intended?\r\n\r\n"
    - "Peripheral blood is called peripheral presumably because it is taken most often\
      \ from a peripheral location of the body, such as an arm.  Blood travels rather\
      \ quickly through the circulatory system, and I believe the assumption is that\
      \ the composition of blood extracted at a peripheral location is roughly similar\
      \ to blood throughout the body, apart from oxygen content.  While there are\
      \ mechanisms for lymphocytes to move into and out of the blood, most researchers\
      \ seem to assume that the relative abundance and levels of lymphocyte subsets\
      \ in blood taken at a peripheral location are representative of the blood as\
      \ a whole.\r\n\r\n"
    - "Thanks, @addiehl. I'm thinking from a clinical perspective where there is a\
      \ distinction in central vs peripheral circulation (central line / PICC line\
      \ vs peripheral IV, blood cultures from peripheral vs central lines, peripheral\
      \ blood smear, drug concentrations before first pass metabolism, cord blood,\
      \ etc). If scientists don't make a distinction between central vs peripheral\
      \ blood, then the EA sounds appropriate.\r\n"

    - Hi CL editors, this ticket was automatically assigned to Nicole when I added

      \ L/M (red/green) cones and S (blue) cones, two types of horizontal cells, ten\
      \ types of bipolar cells in three major groups (rod bipolar, ON cone bipolar,\
      \ and OFF cone bipolar), 17 types of amacrine cells including [glycinergic](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/glycinergic)\
      \ types (e.g., AII amacrine cells, GJD2) and GABAergic types (e.g., starburst\

    - Next step is to identify which of [these terms](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/1606#issuecomment-1265503887)
      constitute new cell types. If there is no need to differentiate these cell types
      based on location (peripheral retina vs fovea), I do not see many/any new terms
      here.
    - Should definitely add amacrine neurons by NT.
    - I think also worth going back to older papers referenced here to find if we
      can define things like 'starburst amacrine cells'
    - '@addiehl  - wasn''t there also work in your group ages ago on defining types
      of retinal ganglion cell that never made it into CL.  Maybe worth a look?'
    - "The retinal CL (RCL) file is attached\r\n[RCL1v7_ds_test.owl.txt](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/files/9789562/RCL1v7_ds_test.owl.txt)\r\
      \n(note that I added the txt extension to get Github to accept the file)\r\n\
      \r\nThis work was performed primarily by Terry Meehan and Patrick Ray @patrick-lloyd-ray\
      \ under my direction when I had moved to the University at Buffalo, with some\
      \ contributions from a couple of summer students who worked with me at the Jackson\
      \ Laboratory.  This file contains 51 classes in the range CL:0003XXX for ganglion\
      \ cells and 57 classes in the range CL:0004XXX for amacrine, bipolar, ganglion,\
      \ and additional cell types.  33 of these cell types are based on BAMS. (these\
      \ IDs have never been used in CL).\r\n\r\nThere are a number of UBERON terms\
      \ referenced in logical definitions as well as 53 of the dreaded \"CP\" cellular\
      \ phenotype terms.  I think there is a lot of good work in this file but it\
      \ probably needs some revision/reengineering if parts of it were to be imported\
      \ into CL.  I think a lot of the cell types are based on mouse, but Patrick\
      \ probably knows better than me.\r\n\r\nThere are 29 types of amacrine cell,\

    - I somehow didn't realise this was Patrick's work!  Makes sense for @shawntanzk
      and @patrick-lloyd-ray to work on folding this into CL.  From the above example,
      I think simplifying formal definitions would be worthwhile, e.g. I think we
      need to lose the negative assertions and probably relax the definition to just
      use subClassOf.
    - 'Happy to look into it, just for coordination, I will start by extracting the
      CL:0003XXX & CL:0004XXX terms in the file and merging it with cl-edit into an

      :) '
    - 'ok take it back, its pretty messy when merging - for review sake, it would
      probably end up better to just manually add these in. Will take a closer look
      and see whats the best way to do that (template or individually) '
    - Where does the messiness of the merge come from? If IDs and imports, can this
      be cleaned up first?
    - no idea, robot merge does some weird stuff. Anyway decided to convert to ofn
      and copy and paste the stuff in manually to edit, changing some of the relations

      \ we've tried to deal with this by using role terms to extend the meaning of\
      \ the chemical entity class (CHEBI has these) but that has never really worked.\
      \ I think the most straightforward solution is to come up with ways to define\
      \ that context by extending the definition of the process.  e.g. \r\n\r\nendocrine\
      \ cell \r\nEquivalentTo: cell that 'capable of' some ('hormone secretion and\

      \ means the solution will work for arthropods too.  If we want to restrict to\

      \ be for GO to define these process terms, as I think this is better for co-ordination\
      \ + organismal terms.  I also think that this general approach makes sense for\
      \ GO.  They really should have separate process terms for, for example, serotonin\
      \ secretion in the gut and serotonin secretion as neurotransmitter given that\
      \ there are likely to be differences in mechanism and regulation + the medical\
      \ importance of the distinction. However, I suspect that they will be resistant\

      \ ticket.  However, I think best not to bother waiting long for a response.\
      \  To make this approach work, we need a mini project dedicated to it.  This\
      \ should:\r\n\r\n(a) Extend the relations guide to document this pattern. (I\
      \ think using subClassOf axioms is going to be more practical in most cases.\
      \  It is not impossible to use DOSDPs for this but would require some thought\
      \ and infrastructure work so we should avoid making this a dependency).\r\n\
      (b) work through various endocrine cells and organs in CL & Uberon implementing\
      \ and checking inference. (Fixing for one general class is pointless)\r\nIf\
      \ GO does end up creating the process terms, we could always update.\r\n\r\n\
      Missing piece:\r\nCo-ordination across ontologies is always a challenge.   Ideally\
      \ we'd have some rigorous ontology design pattern system that is shared across\
      \ interdependent ontologies.  However we have neither the time nor the resources\
      \ for this.  Instead I think we need some centralised, human readable documentation\
      \ for major shared design patterns.  This mini project could be a proof-of-concept\
      \ pilot for this approach.  \r\n\r\nOntologies that could benefit from shared\

      [PMID:28923980](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28923980/):\r\n\"Today, M1 is\
      \ often used for classically activated macrophages ([16](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/199/7/2191.long#ref-16))\
      \ and M2 for alternatively activated macrophages ([17](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/199/7/2191.long#ref-17)).\
      \ Although there are similarities in phenotype, this use of the M1/M2 nomenclature\
      \ is incorrect: unlike classically activated macrophages, M1 polarization does\
      \ not require IFN-\u03B3, and unlike alternatively activated macrophages, M2\
      \ polarization does not require IL-4.\"\r\n\r\n\"Although there are similarities\
      \ between M2 macrophages and alternatively activated (by IL-4) macrophages ([31](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/199/7/2191.long#ref-31)),\
      \ they are not the same. No IL-4 is found in healing wounds ([32](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/199/7/2191.long#ref-32)).\
      \ Similarly, it is well known that LPS is sufficient to induce an M1 phenotype,\
      \ and T cell\u2013derived IFN-\u03B3, the hallmark of classical macrophage activation\
      \ ([16](https://www.jimmunol.org/content/199/7/2191.long#ref-16)), is not required.\
      \ Thus, classically activated macrophages are an amplified (by IFN-\u03B3) version\
      \ of M1 macrophages, but in the primary immune response, macrophages instruct\
      \ T cells.\""

    - Hi @rachadele, can you clarify if you intend for this class to only represent
      a cell type in **humans** as noted in your definition? I see the reference paper
      is focused on humans, but if this cell type exists in other species or genera,
      we can remove the word "human" from the definition and not worry about taxon
      restrictions.

      the submission to fail validation. i'm guessing maybe their validator tool pulls
      valid ontologies from OLS since it doesn't seem to recognize this term. I will
      have to ask their devs about it :)
    - btws just a small thing, but our preference is for people to pull the ontology
      through our purl system (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/cl.owl) - it's something
      that I'm supposed to tell people using it. Using the purl = if we change anything
      (eg how we do releases), it won't affect your pipelines. If your devs are going
      to change where they pull the ontology from, maybe suggest that to them :) thanks!

    - 'I''m ok with having my terms apostrophes removed - added them as it was probably
      how the paper used it, don''t think removal would affect much on our side. Thanks '
    - Commenting late, but looks good.  @hdrabkin  - we can't promise to always keep
      apostrophes out of synonyms where these are valid/important.  I think MGI needs
      to look at fixing their loader.
    - '@dosumis, I think it was the double quotes around the synonym that is the problem"  Maybe
      not. I''m just passing the complaint on from our SEs.'

  - American English spellings are the convention in CL, so "specialises" should be
    "specializes".
  - Consider updating definition of 'subcommissural organ' since it only invokes 'ependymal
    cells', although hypendymal cells may be rare in non-mammals (PMID:9579598).

      but I don't think it matters to GO whether an external term is an alt_id or
      instead just obsoleted normally with a replaced_by annotation. The pipeline
      in that comment is an MGI system I think, not GO central.

  - "Why is the label 'club-like cell of ....' and not ' club cell of ...'?\r\nI skimmed\
    \ the 3 dbxref annotations on the definition and did not see the \"like\" terminology\
    \ used."
  - Is there a dbxref to support this exact synonym?
  - I only skimmed the references, but did not find mention of this cell in PMID:31390564.
    Did I miss it?
  - "Free text definition for your consideration:\r\n\"An epithelial cell of the urethra\
    \ that has an expression profile similar to lung club cells. (+ gloss)\""
  - club cell has implications of it being lung cell type. While it is used generally
    as such, I think for the ontology (which doesn't have context like in the papers)
    I wanted to be careful not to be misleading. The cell type is only called club
    cell cause of its similarity to lung type, hence the use of "-like". Totally why
    people hate ontology names lol
  - 'not gonna lie, i just took the requestors word for it lol, but thanks for checking,
    will double check and remove if it is not in there. I like your suggestion for
    def, gives it room if things changes, will change accordingly, thanks. '
  - if you mean the "-like" part, nope, but see above for reasoning
  - Do you have other examples where this reasoning / naming convention is used? Using
    a term for the refs:label that is not referenced anywhere seems like a questionable
    practice.
  - Perhaps using your ORCiD as a dbxref would be appropriate.
  - 'did that heaps for BDSO when names were misleading :) also see http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_4029003
    happy to add to the comment the choice of "-like" '
  - 'do we do that for synonyms? but sure, happy to :) '
  - I see it is also not a subclass of 'club cell', which if it were, would be problematic
    because of the way club cell is defined. Down the road, perhaps 'club cell' will
    be a new superclass and the current 'club cell' will become 'club cell of the
    bronchiole'....
  - "In practice, I try to find a source to justify synonyms I add. \r\nIn this case,\
    \ @shawntanzk is the source :)"
  - "> http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_4029003\r\n\r\nFYI, after clicking the link:\
    \ \"Term Not Found\" \r\nBut I do see it in owl-edit.owl"
  - "lol yeah, i started by putting it as a subclass of club cell then realise it\
    \ was super weird and hence this whole thing changed to a way more complicated\
    \ ticket >.< was hoping this would be an easy one for @ar-ibrahim to handle, but\
    \ of course nothing ends up straightforward lol \r\nI think I'd rather not club\
    \ cell as a new superclass, as usage-wise, it seems that \"club cells\" is more\
    \ widely used to mean \"club cell of the bronchiole\". I guess its the messy art\
    \ of finding an in between of being accurate yet trying to represent the messy\
    \ world of biology. This is totally why whole workshops have been had on naming\
    \ cell types. "
  - "> FYI, after clicking the link: \"Term Not Found\"\r\n\r\nthat.... is not good\
    \ :( sigh, ill investigate and figure out if its our side or ontobee side"
  - oh lol, its a more recently added term, not in release yet, hence not in ontobee,
    no worries
  - "\"**Prostate club cells** are similar to lung club cells in their enrichment\
    \ of immunomodulatory programs\" PMID:[30566875](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30566875)\r\
    \n\r\n'prostate club cell' seems like a valid synonym (or a candidate for rdfs:label)."
  - "Is this because the cell is SCGB1A1+? I did not see this expression mentioned\
    \ explicitly in the dbxrefs other than mentioning this gene.\r\n"
  - 'yesh - there has been lots of arguments on why that isn''t accurate (eg expressing
    transcript does not = expressing protein), but CL decided to use PRO for expression
    so I guess we have to stick to it. '
  - 'I have the same issue on that with club cell of urethral epithelium, it still
    says club cell when its not REALLY a club cell (or at least how we use it), but
    will add as synonym '
  - "> eg expressing transcript does not = expressing protein\r\n\r\nThat was my concern\
    \ with this axiom. The dbxrefs don't explicitly mention the expression.\r\n\r\n\
    > but CL decided to use PRO for expression so I guess we have to stick to it.\r\
    \n\r\nHopefully this is documented somewhere..."
  - "> its not REALLY a club cell (or at least how we use it)\r\n\r\nThat is what\
    \ my comment is probing -- the way CL defines 'club cell' (i.e., only restricted\
    \ to lung)."
  - "> Hopefully this is documented somewhere...\r\n\r\nIt really should in CL docs,\
    \ but I really don't want to be the person to write this cause like you, I don't\
    \ fully agree with using PR for things like these for that exact reasons >.<"
  - There is an extra space before "SCGB1A1" in the text definition.
  - hmmm we should probably implement a check for double space

  - In the definition, should "Bushy cells give" be "A bushy cell gives" to keep the
    cell type in singular form?
  - In definition, "Sperhical" appears to be a typo and should "Spherical bush cells
    give" be changed to singular form?
  - In definition, should "larger" be "large"? Otherwise, it is larger compared to
    what? Should "Globular bushy cells extend" be changed to singular form?
  - 'I tend to only keep singular for definidum. As I am referring to all bushy cells
    in the gloss, I think plural is the more appropriate thing to use (also it sounds
    better lol). '
  - 'omg it took me 3 tooks to find the difference between "Sperhical" and "Spherical"

    - "@dosumis In FBbt, `nurse cell` is a subClassOf `female germline cell` and is\
      \ defined as \u201Cone of a group of 15 germ cells that lie anterior to the\
      \ oocyte within the egg chamber.\u201D These cells are, indeed, always germ\
      \ cells.\r\n\r\nOf note, in CL we already have `invertebrate nurse cell` (CL:0000026),\
      \ which is also a subClassOf `germ line cell` and is defined as \u201Ca germline\
      \ cell that contributes to the development of the oocyte by transferring cytoplasm\
      \ directly to oocyte\u201C. That term is cross-referenced to FBbt\u2019s `nurse\
      \ cell`.\r\n\r\nDo all \u201Cnurse cells\u201D derive from the germline throughout\
      \ species? Apparently not.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, germline-derived nurse cells\
      \ have been described in insects (obviously), in nematodes, in hydra ([Alexandrova\
      \ et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2005.02.015)); in mouse, non-oocyte-forming\
      \ germline-derived cyst cells have been shown to transfer organelles to the\
      \ oocyte, leading to them being called \u201Cnurselike germ cells\u201C ([Lei\
      \ and Spradling, 2016](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aad2156)).\r\n\r\nOn\
      \ the other hand, reptiles, birds, and amphibians have \u201Cpyriform cells\u201D\
      , described by [del Pino (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.ctdb.2020.10.008)\
      \ as \u201Cnurse cells of somatic origin\u201D which \u201Cenrich the oocyte\
      \ with transcripts, proteins and organelles\u201D.\r\n\r\nAlso in mammals, Sertoli\

      \ a consensus in the literature as to which cells should be called \u201Cnurse\

    - 'I am fine with having the hepatic progenitor cell as synonym of the Oval cell.
      My only concern is that the hepatic progenitor cell term is only use  in adult
      human terminology and refer to a rodent counter part (oval cell) that can only
      differentiate in 2 specific cell types and they are different from hepatic stem
      cell that derived from bone marrow.  I will not change ''_hepatic oval cell_''
      with ''_haptic oval stem cell_'' this will create more confusion.  I have some
      concerns on the fact that in CL _progenitor cell_ are parent of _stem cell_
      instead to be the reverse. Stem cell can differentiate in many cell types and
      are reserve cells that have the ability to change into many different types
      of cells and grow indefinitely. They have the potential to create many new different
      cells that can help replace dying and/or damaged cells. .Progenitor cell can
      only hey are already more specific than stem cells and can only be pushed to
      differentiate into its "target" cell. '

    - "1) The difference in terminology between adult hepatic progenitor cell and\
      \ hepatic oval cell seems to be human vs rat.  From PMID: [28135758](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28135758):\r\
      \n\"In this scenario, adult hepatic stem/progenitor cells, termed hepatic progenitor\
      \ cells (HPCs) in humans[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534384/#R4)\
      \ and oval cells in rodents,[5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534384/#R5)\

      \r\n2) Stem cell vs progenitor cell are blurred into \"stem/progenitor cell\"\
      \ in many source papers because they are talking about the transitional state\
      \ from one to the other.  \r\n3) There also is a difference between normal liver\
      \ regenerative capacity and regenerative capacity when specifically injured.\
      \ It seems like, from the paper above that hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) are\
      \ performing their function in response to injury.  \r\n4) There also seems\
      \ to be more than one distinguishable hepatic progenitor cells (HPCs) at the\
      \ protein marker level , one that is functioning during uninjured liver state\
      \ vs injured liver state and associated niche in liver (also described in this\
      \ \r\npaper).\"However, it has been reported recently that newly-identified\
      \ hepatic stem/progenitor cells resides around the central vein in normal liver,[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534384/#R11)\
      \ and the endothelial cells at the central vein produce Wnt2 and Wnt9b as short-range\
      \ signals for these stem/progenitor cells, and constitute a portion of their\
      \ niche. These pericentral stem/progenitor cells are distinct from aforementioned\
      \ HSCs, as pericentral stem/progenitor cells maintain hepatocyte homeostasis\
      \ in the uninjured liver while HSCs have only been reported after injury. Another\
      \ difference is that pericentral stem/progenitor cells contribute only to the\
      \ hepatocyte lineage rather than other liver cell types including biliary epithelial\
      \ cells.[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5534384/#R11)\""

  - There is only one other pending NTR at the moment.
  - Good catch. It may be due to working in another ontology and I did not update
    the range when in CL or a typo. Will update...

  - Will leave as is.
  - 'For defs, I would prefer "A hillock cell that..." as it is asserted as that.
    Not a huge deal IMO, but would make the def more readable imo, but up to you to

  - Yes, ignore that minor detail :D
  - If you want an explanation ask again in Tech call
  - Yesh, I agree @anitacaron NIFSTD would work lets wait for @cthoyt to get his opinion.
  - "neither of these are in bioregistry, therefore you can assume I don't have an\
    \ opinion :p \r\n\r\nbut as far as NIF's sprawl of namespaces, I think this is\
    \ because nobody really knows what any of these do. Can you spot check that these\

  - Yes, of course we did! They do.
  - Would one of you be willing to submit a bioregistry new prefix request then?

  - Just to clarify and resolve this comment, we agree to use the prefix NIFEXT that
    is going to be added in the bioregistry via https://github.com/biopragmatics/bioregistry/issues/404.

    comments:
    - I believe the names were capitalized because they were based on classic fractionation
      methods for B cells in mice that were capitalized in the original papers, but
      I need to go back to check.  Probably they should be taxon restricted as well.  I
      will get back to you.
    - This issue has not seen any activity in the past 6 months; it will be closed
      automatically in one year from now if no action is taken.
    - I fixed the capitalisation, and made some exact synonyms broad instead. The
      taxon specificity is in rdfs:comments already, so I'll go ahead and close.

      \nand part of Lymph Node (UBERON:0000029).\r\nThis alone raises the question\
      \ \"are FRCs only ever found in lymph nodes\". A quick PubMed search confirms\
      \ that FRCs are found elsewhere in lymphoid organs.\r\nWhile investigating,\
      \ I noticed that the existing CL term 'reticular cell' is defined as \"Large,\
      \ stellate fibroblast found along the network of collagen fibers of the reticulum\
      \ of the spleen; synthesize the matrix components of the reticulum.\" (but it's\
      \ not part_of spleen) and has this Wikipedia entry as def dbxref (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell).\
      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\
      \ mesenchymal, and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells\
      \ are involved in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within the\
      \ tissue whereas epithelial and mesenchymal reticular cells are associated with\
      \ certain areas of the brain.\"\r\nBased on these considerations, I plan to\r\
      \n\r\n- [x] Broaden the applicability of 'reticular cell' by changing the definition\
      \ to \"A fibroblast that synthesizes collagen and uses it to produce reticular\

      \ not part_of spleen) and has this Wikipedia entry as def dbxref (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell).\
      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\
      \ mesenchymal, and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells\

  - Adding refs on subClassOf axioms is good for traceability but I don't think it
    standard practice at present (@shawntanzk  - are we doing this elsewhere?)
  - Yes, we do it in BDSO for expresses axioms. I think we might also add refs to
    some taxon annotations which is basically adding it to subclass axioms in a roundabout
    way. That being said, if the subclass axioms matches the definitions, is there
    a reason for adding it on the axiom rather than just the definition?

      \ extraglomerular, extravascular space of the kidney. It is bounded on all sides\
      \ by tubular and vascular basement membranes and is filled with cells, extracellular\
      \ matrix, and interstitial fluid ([1](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/10/10/1831#ref-1)).\
      \ Its distribution varies within the kidney; it accounts for approximately 8%\
      \ of the total parenchymal volume in the cortex and up to 40% in the inner medulla\
      \ ([6](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/10/10/1831#ref-6),[7](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/10/10/1831#ref-7)).\

      \ are considered specialized interstitia ([1](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/10/10/1831#ref-1)).\
      \ It is debated whether microvessels and capillaries, which are located within\

      \ run through it ([1](https://cjasn.asnjournals.org/content/10/10/1831#ref-1)).\

    - This ticket was originally assigned to @nicolevasilevsky , but perhaps @gouttegd
      and/or @dosumis would like to comment re. Diptera. Thanks in advance!
    - "In obophenotype/uberon#1524, @dosumis suggested that the two terms (`follicular\
      \ cell of ovary` and `ovarian follicle cell`) could be merged as they appeared\
      \ to be duplicates. It is true that, strictly within CL, the two terms are redundant.\r\
      \n\r\nHowever, I do note that we have in Uberon two distinct terms to refer\
      \ to the mammalian follicle (`ovarian follicle`, UBERON:0001305) and the insect\
      \ follicle a.k.a egg chamber (`egg chamber`, UBERON:0003199). While `egg chamber`\
      \ has been marked as \u201Ccandidate for obsoletion\u201D, I actually think\
      \ that it should be retained since `ovarian follicle` is a bit too specific\
      \ to cover the case of non-mammalian follicles (e.g., it has a `has_part some\
      \ 'follicular fluid'`, which I don\u2019t think would be correct for insect\
      \ follicles). And if we have two terms in Uberon for the follicles themselves,\
      \ it kind of makes sense to have two terms as well in CL to refer to the corresponding\
      \ cells.\r\n\r\nTherefore I would agree with @dosumis \u2019s _other_ suggestion\
      \ in obophenotype/uberon#1524, which is to rename `ovarian follicle cell` (CL:0000477)\
      \ to `follicle cell of egg chamber`. Coupled with the taxon rules suggested\
      \ above (CL:0000477 restricted to _Diptera_ and CL:0002174 excluding _Diptera_),\
      \ and either a mention in the text definition or a comment, this should help\
      \ distinguish between the two terms as requested.\r\n\r\n(It would then optionally\
      \ be possible to add a new, more generic term for \u201Cfollicle cell\u201D\
      \ encompassing both the mammalian one and the insect one, with the definition\
      \ suggested (again) by @dosumis: \u201Can epithelial somatic cell associated\
      \ with a maturing oocyte\u201D, which as far as I know is valid for all follicle\
      \ cells regardless of species.)\r\n\r\nI can take care of implementing this\
      \ proposal if we agree on it."

      \ \"are FRCs only ever found in lymph nodes\". A quick PubMed search confirms\
      \ that FRCs are found elsewhere in lymphoid organs.\r\nWhile investigating,\
      \ I noticed that the existing CL term 'reticular cell' is defined as \"Large,\
      \ stellate fibroblast found along the network of collagen fibers of the reticulum\
      \ of the spleen; synthesize the matrix components of the reticulum.\" (but it's\
      \ not part_of spleen) and has this Wikipedia entry as def dbxref (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell).\
      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\
      \ mesenchymal, and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells\
      \ are involved in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within the\
      \ tissue whereas epithelial and mesenchymal reticular cells are associated with\
      \ certain areas of the brain.\"\r\nBased on these considerations, I plan to\r\
      \n\r\n- [x] Broaden the applicability of 'reticular cell' by changing the definition\
      \ to \"A fibroblast that synthesizes collagen and uses it to produce reticular\
      \ fibers, thus providing structural support. Reticular cells are found in many\

      \ as a subclass of 'fibroblastic reticular cell', with broad synonym 'fibroblastic\

      \ \"are FRCs only ever found in lymph nodes\". A quick PubMed search confirms\

      \ stellate fibroblast found along the network of collagen fibers of the reticulum\
      \ of the spleen; synthesize the matrix components of the reticulum.\" (but it's\
      \ not part_of spleen) and has this Wikipedia entry as def dbxref (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell).\
      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\
      \ mesenchymal, and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells\
      \ are involved in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within the\
      \ tissue whereas epithelial and mesenchymal reticular cells are associated with\
      \ certain areas of the brain.\"\r\nBased on these considerations, I plan to\r\
      \n\r\n- [x] Broaden the applicability of 'reticular cell' by changing the definition\
      \ to \"A fibroblast that synthesizes collagen and uses it to produce reticular\
      \ fibers, thus providing structural support. Reticular cells are found in many\

      \ \r\nThis is all great! I was \u201CLN\u201D focused when I wrote the entries,\
      \ but these cells are critical to all tissues. Good grab.\r\n  \r\nTake care,\r\
      \nA\r\n \r\n \r\nSee my comments below.\r\n[ ] Broaden the applicability of\
      \ 'reticular cell' by changing the definition to \"A fibroblast that synthesizes\
      \ collagen and uses it to produce reticular fibers, thus providing structural\
      \ support. Reticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen, lymph\
      \ nodes and kidneys. Subtypes of reticular cells include epithelial, mesenchymal,\
      \ and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells are involved\
      \ in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within a tissue, whereas\
      \ epithelial and mesenchymal reticular cells are associated with certain areas\
      \ of the brain.\"\r\n **Great. Agree.**\r\n[ ] Create a tissue-agnostic term\
      \ 'fibroblastic reticular cell' as a subclass of 'myofibroblast cell' (CL:0000186)\
      \ and 'reticular cell' \r\n**Great. Agree.**\r\n[ ] Create 'lymph node fibroblastic\
      \ reticular cell' as a subclass of 'fibroblastic reticular cell', with broad\
      \ synonym. \r\n**Agree. The LN FRCs are so diverse and change with disease.\
      \ Use this definition for 'lymph node fibroblastic reticular cell': Specialized\
      \ cells of mesenchymal origin that express several markers common to myofibroblasts\
      \ (desmin, vimentin, CD73, CD90, \u03B1-smooth muscle actin (\u03B1SMA) and\
      \ can be differentiated from endothelial cells by their lack of CD31 expression.\
      \ These cells are critical for the overall organization and function of the\
      \ lymph node. Within the lymph node, fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) can\
      \ be further classified based on their location, function, and unique marker\
      \ expression**\r\n"

      \ \"are FRCs only ever found in lymph nodes\". A quick PubMed search confirms\
      \ that FRCs are found elsewhere in lymphoid organs.\r\nWhile investigating,\

      \ stellate fibroblast found along the network of collagen fibers of the reticulum\
      \ of the spleen; synthesize the matrix components of the reticulum.\" (but it's\
      \ not part_of spleen) and has this Wikipedia entry as def dbxref (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell).\
      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\
      \ mesenchymal, and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells\
      \ are involved in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within the\
      \ tissue whereas epithelial and mesenchymal reticular cells are associated with\
      \ certain areas of the brain.\"\r\nBased on these considerations, I plan to\r\
      \n\r\n- [x] Broaden the applicability of 'reticular cell' by changing the definition\

      \ not part_of spleen) and has this Wikipedia entry as def dbxref (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell).\
      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\
      \ mesenchymal, and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells\
      \ are involved in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within the\
      \ tissue whereas epithelial and mesenchymal reticular cells are associated with\
      \ certain areas of the brain.\"\r\nBased on these considerations, I plan to\r\
      \n\r\n- [x] Broaden the applicability of 'reticular cell' by changing the definition\

      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\

      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\

      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\

      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\

      \ not part_of spleen) and has this Wikipedia entry as def dbxref (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell).\
      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\

      \ are involved in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within the\

      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\

      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\

      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\

      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\

      \ not part_of spleen) and has this Wikipedia entry as def dbxref (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_cell).\
      \ It says:\r\n\"A reticular cell is a type of fibroblast that synthesizes collagen\
      \ alpha-1(III) and uses it to produce reticular fibers. The cell surrounds the\
      \ fibers with its cytoplasm, isolating them from other tissue components and\
      \ cells.[1] Reticular cells provide structural support, since they produce and\
      \ maintain the thin networks of fibers that are a framework for most lymphoid\
      \ organs.\r\nReticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen,\
      \ lymph nodes and kidneys. They are also found within tissues, such as lymph\
      \ nodules. There are different types of reticular cells, including epithelial,\
      \ mesenchymal, and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells\
      \ are involved in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within the\

      \ certain areas of the brain.\"\r\nBased on these considerations, I plan to\r\

      \ but these cells are critical to all tissues. Good grab.\r\n  \r\nTake care,\r\
      \nA\r\n \r\n \r\nSee my comments below.\r\n[ ] Broaden the applicability of\
      \ 'reticular cell' by changing the definition to \"A fibroblast that synthesizes\
      \ collagen and uses it to produce reticular fibers, thus providing structural\
      \ support. Reticular cells are found in many organs, including the spleen, lymph\
      \ nodes and kidneys. Subtypes of reticular cells include epithelial, mesenchymal,\
      \ and fibroblastic reticular cells. Fibroblastic reticular cells are involved\
      \ in directing B cells and T cells to specific regions within a tissue, whereas\
      \ epithelial and mesenchymal reticular cells are associated with certain areas\
      \ of the brain.\"\r\n **Great. Agree.**\r\n[ ] Create a tissue-agnostic term\
      \ 'fibroblastic reticular cell' as a subclass of 'myofibroblast cell' (CL:0000186)\
      \ and 'reticular cell' \r\n**Great. Agree.**\r\n[ ] Create 'lymph node fibroblastic\
      \ reticular cell' as a subclass of 'fibroblastic reticular cell', with broad\
      \ synonym. \r\n**Agree. The LN FRCs are so diverse and change with disease.\
      \ Use this definition for 'lymph node fibroblastic reticular cell': Specialized\
      \ cells of mesenchymal origin that express several markers common to myofibroblasts\
      \ (desmin, vimentin, CD73, CD90, \u03B1-smooth muscle actin (\u03B1SMA) and\
      \ can be differentiated from endothelial cells by their lack of CD31 expression.\
      \ These cells are critical for the overall organization and function of the\
      \ lymph node. Within the lymph node, fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) can\
      \ be further classified based on their location, function, and unique marker\
      \ expression**\r\n"

    - '@bvarner-ebi Sorry for the late notice, but instead of part of UBERON:0003889
      (fallopian tube), should be better consider part of ciliated columnar oviduct
      epithelium  UBERON:0007589, as just requested for "fallopian tube ciliated cell"?'
    - "Hi @paulacalipho, thank you for the question. \r\nDo you have a source to support\
      \ that the 'fallopian tube secretory epithelial cell' is part of the 'ciliated\
      \ columnar oviduct epithelium'? Otherwise, we could make it part of the less\
      \ specific UBERON:0004804 'oviduct epithelium'."
    - '@bvarner-ebi As "fallopian tube secretory epithelial cell'''' is part of the
      "fallopian tube epithelium" that have also ciliated cells, I assumed that is
      a ciliated epithelium. But I may be wrong and would be better to make part of
      UBERON:0004804 ''oviduct epithelium''. '
    - "@paulacalipho, my hesitation is not knowing if this cell type is always found\
      \ in what would be classified as ciliated columnar oviduct epithelium since\
      \ there is variation in the epithelium of the oviduct both spatially and temporally.\
      \ \r\n\r\nPer PMID:[25117646](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25117646):\r\
      \n\r\nThe mucosal surface of the fallopian tube consists of one layer of simple\
      \ columnar epithelium, which appears to be pseudo-stratified. Of these simple\
      \ columnar cells, 25% are ciliated columnar cells (Fig.\_2), 60% are secretory\
      \ cells and less than 10% are intercalated cells [5, 6]. The ciliated cells\
      \ are mainly found on the apex of the mucosal folds [7], mostly in the fimbria\
      \ (over 50\_%) and less commonly in the isthmus (less than 35\_%) [5, 6, 8].\
      \ Cilia extend from the apical surface of the ciliated cells into the lumen\
      \ of the tube and are about 10\_\u03BCm long and 0.25\_\u03BCm in diameter [9].\
      \ Secretory cells are non-ciliated cells and contain apical granules that produce\
      \ the tubular fluid. The least common cell type are intercalated cells, also\
      \ known as peg cells whose function and even existence as a discrete cell type\
      \ is a matter of debate. While some authors consider them a distinct type of\
      \ secretory cells whose contents have been extruded with resulting collapsed\
      \ cytoplasm [10], others consider them as merely representing a morphological\
      \ variant of the classic secretory cells [11, 12]. Tubal epithelium undergoes\
      \ cyclical changes in response to ovarian steroids which can be evident as a\
      \ higher percentage of ciliated cells in the follicular phase, with gradual\
      \ transition into a secretory cell-dominant pattern in the luteal phase of the\
      \ cycle [10, 12]."
    - '@bvarner-ebi OK, in that case is better relate it to UBERON:0004804 ''oviduct
      epithelium''. In addition the creation of the peg cells may not be recommended'
    - "Thanks for the feedback, @paulacalipho.\r\n\r\nSince this term is a subclass\
      \ of 'oviduct glandular cell', it being part of the 'oviduct epithelium' is\

    to the protein Troponin C for example. Of course the context is key, but researchers
    using automated text mining may run into a spurious match because exact synonyms
    are usually considered on a par with labels. So in this case it may be safer to

    - Hi @paolaroncaglia, since you have been involved in creating new terms related
      to thymus cells, do you have any comments on this request? Particularly, do
      you have a comment on whether a 'thymic nurse cell' should be one new class
      or broken into separate classes for cortical and corticomedullary types? I think
      a case could be made for either option, but would one approach be preferred?
    - "Hi @addiehl ,\r\nWould you be able to provide feedback on this please? We can\
      \ take care of the edits. Thanks in advance!"
    - '@bvarner-ebi and @paulacalipho one thing I recall from working on thymus cell
      types for the ASCT+B tables is that e.g. for subtypes of double-negative thymocytes
      there were significant differences in markers between human and mouse. The parent
      cell type for this request (''epithelial cell of thymus'') is, rightfully, species-agnostic.
      The [Wikipedia entry that Paula referenced](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thymic_nurse_cell),
      based on its bibliography, includes a mix of human and mouse studies. The [paper
      that Bradley quoted](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2830717/)
      is based on mouse cells only. Unless unequivocal evidence is available that
      the same markers (human/mouse homologs) are found in each population, I''d keep
      that information in definition gloss or rdfs:comment, rather than use it to
      support subclasses. As for using the thymus location to support subclasses or
      not, at a quick glance again that partly depends on the balance between having
      a single term that''s more broadly applicable (to other mammalian species for
      example) vs. having two granular terms as long as you can support them adequately.
      It''s not even clear to me if nurse cells are _always_ part of both thymus cortex
      and cortico-medullary junction, so the less risky option would be to have one
      class of TNC as part of thymus, but I haven''t delved into the literature.'
    - Thanks for the insight, @paolaroncaglia! Based on your feedback, it seems like
      creating a single new class for TNC seems appropriate. We can get more granular
      in the future as needed and if more specific literature is found.

    - "Hi; the direction of this is causing us (MGI) problems.\r\nIt looks like CL:0002609\
      \ is depreciated and CL:0010012 is the new term. \r\nHowever, since both had\
      \ the same definition, it would to us have more sense if CL:0002609 remained\
      \ the primary term with the name changed, and the name for CL:0010012  be a\
      \ synonym. \r\nCL:0002609 has been used for almost 200 GO annotations to 87\

    - "I think that \"breaking\" something is inevitable with obsoleting things like\

      \ this is why it showed up like that when I searched. \r\nAnyways, it appears\
      \ that the annotations flagged are not prevented from loading into the MGI db\

    - "@shawntanzk, I wonder if the lack of alt_id and the synonym is why it can't\

    - synonym is totally my fault - sorry about that, totally missed it. I've not
      really done alt_id though, always thought we just added item_replaced_by. But
      if its important to have alt_id we should have it in our docs.
    - " We do add the replaced by when we obsolete a term if there is a clear id to\
      \ use instead. \r\n"

      \ >.<) I can probably do a release immediately after the change.' \r\nAt the\
      \ moment MGI is using through GO, but we have just started loading the CL in\
      \ our backend for use with GXD (gene expression db) and Alleles and Phenotype.\
      \ \r\nHowever note that it is difficult to search on the older term. I am wondering\
      \ if the key is to add the alt id, so that when I search on 2609, I get back\
      \ annotations that are using it? I can't tell at the moment. As for our in-house\
      \ interface, I put in a work order to try to replace all instances of 2609 with\
      \ the 0012 term. That request is being triaged now."
    - 'I think one lesson from this is that we should look in to keeping alt_ids as
      part of our merge system/SOPs to support legacy users. Broader OBO discussion:  should
      we make sure we have automated support for this (e.g. adding alt_ids automatically)?
      Or should we be aiming to retire support at some specified later date, with
      clear guidance for migration?'

    - These 'CP' terms were created years ago to capture cellular phenotypes.  The
      CP prefix has never been registered with OBO foundry, nor is there an actual
      CP ontology, though we once thought of doing one.  In retrospect, this is just
      an ugly hack, and I agree we should obsolete these terms and replace with terms
      from a more appropriate source, perhaps PATO.
    - "If they are cellular phenotypes, maybe we should align them with uPheno phenotypes\
      \ as well? Here three options:\r\n\r\n1. Obsolete all CP terms and replace by\
      \ fresh CL ids. Apply uPheno patterns instead of the now incompatible bearer-of\
      \ pattern.\r\n2. Move CP terms as they are to a new ontology called cellular\
      \ phenotype ontology. Use uPheno patterns. There are likely to emerge more cellular\
      \ phenotypes! \r\n3. Extent [CMPO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cmpo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%2Fcmpo%2FCMPO_0000303).\

      \ cell types ('oligodendrocyte/type-2 astrocyte progenitor cell' and 'oligodendrocyte\
      \ precursor cell') may be referring to the same thing.\r\n\r\nFrom PMID:10704434:\r\
      \n\r\n\"Oligodendrocytes arise from a well-defined precursor cell that also\
      \ can give rise to a specific astrocyte population (the type-2 astrocyte) in\
      \ vitro ([Raff et al. 1983](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2174536/#Raffetal1983)),\

      \ development ([Skoff 1990](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2174536/#Skoff1990)).\
      \ Due to this disparity, this single precursor cell is alternatively called\
      \ an oligodendrocyte type-2 astrocyte (O-2A) progenitor or an oligodendrocyte\
      \ precursor cell (OPC).\"\r\n\r\nFrom https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-14207-0:\r\
      \n\r\n\"In addition, we found that Venus-positive OPCs were able to differentiate\
      \ to type II astrocytes. In vivo, OPCs and oligodendrocytes express Venus, and\
      \ some of astrocytes were positive for Venus in the ventral cortex.\"\r\n\r\n\
      From https://doi.org/10.1242/dev.126409:\r\n\r\n\"Oligodendrocytes are the myelinating\
      \ cells of the central nervous system (CNS), and the last major neural phenotype\
      \ to form during development. They arise from oligodendrocyte progenitor cells\
      \ (OPCs), which can generate either oligodendrocytes or astrocytes depending\
      \ on context ([ffrench-Constant and Raff, 1986]); [Raff et al., 1983a].\"\r\n\

    - It looks like germ cell already has the SubClass Of (Anonymous Ancestor) 'capable
      of' some 'reproductive process', and therefore gamete does too. So maybe removing

  - The term as is inherits "part of some nervous system". I'm not sure how far the
    projections of these neurons go, but based on the definitions, should they be
    part of some _central_ nervous system more specifically?
  - This term is inferred as subclass of CARO_0000000, is that expected?
  - '"coexpress" should read "coexpresses" please.'
  - 'This should change to something more specific once adding UBERON ''has soma location''
    comes in. It''s not wrong at the moment, so I''d rather not add something that
    I would have to remove as a redundant subclass later on (cause I will 100% forget

  - Hi @shawntanzk , is the ebi celline definition thing ok, or was it a setting left
    from previous edits maybe for BDS?
  - oh that is 100% wrong - I know what this is, will make a change, thanks for spotting
  - "@shawntanzk if you agree to make the term broadly applicable beyond mouse, I'd\
    \ remove \"mouse\" from the definition ;-)\r\nYou may add an rdfs: comment or\
    \ a definition gloss stating that the cell type was first identified in mouse\
    \ if you wish."
  - whoops >.< thanks for the catch! and yes, a comment is a good idea :) thanks
  - '@shawntanzk sorry for not seeing it sooner: An interneuron ... expresses (instead
    of express)'
  - '@shawntanzk "in mouse" instead of "in the mouse" sounds slightly better to me,
    but it''s ~6pm and I''m starting to see only trees and ignore the forest, so I''ll
    stop here - you''re good to merge! Thank you.'
  - yeah definitely not with the - my mind was thinking in the taxon >.< lol - I need
    Grammarly for protege :p lol thanks for all the catches!

    - "term: oxytocin receptor interneuron (Mus musculus) \r\n\r\ndef: An interneuron\
      \ located in the mouse cerebral cortex that express the oxytocin receptor. These\
      \ interneurons also express somatostatin (sst). [PMID:25303526]\r\n\r\nparent\
      \ term: interneuron \r\n\r\naxioms: \r\n'has soma location' some 'cerebral cortex'\
      \ \r\n'capable of' some 'gamma-aminobutryic acid secretion, neurotransmission'\r\
      \n'expresses' some 'somatostation'\r\n'expresses' some 'oxytocin receptor' (PR:000001635)\
      \ <- needs to be imported\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nI suggest we make this term specifically\
      \ to mouse as their experiments were done on mouse and I'm not sure how generalisable\
      \ they are. Happy to change it more general if appropriate. \r\nI've put it\
      \ as a cerebral cortex interneuron as the paper similar looked specifically\
      \ at the cerebral cortex \r\nThis would automatically classify it as a SST GABAergic\
      \ cortical interneuron - something we have created for BDS - interesting how\
      \ this did not get mapped to a transcriptomic cluster. This could be due to\
      \ a few things imo:\r\n1) it is a subcluster that didn't get pick up in heirachical\
      \ clustering \r\n2) it is a cell type that cuts across transcriptomic clusters\r\
      \n3) it didnt get mapped as the annotations are manually done \r\nWhat worries\
      \ me is that this might result in duplicate term called different names (I've\
      \ done some searches and dont see this obviously at least). Happy to still add\
      \ the term, might be useful for peoples annotations if they look at oxtrINs,\
      \ but probably want some input from someone more experienced to this issue before\
      \ I do. @cmungall @dosumis "

    title: 'Dangling CARO term and CARO incompatibility with CL '
  - body: "Currently, there is a dangling CARO term (CARO_0010000) that is used by\
      \ a RO term (directly develops from) that is used in UBERON term (equiv class\
      \ for maxillary artery) that used by another uberon term (deep auricular artery)\
      \ that isn't used by any term except itself (I think). \r\nI tried to solve\
      \ the dangling term by doing and import of that CARO term, however when trying\
      \ to test a release, CARO seems to be incompatible with CL -> error saying that\
      \ there are unsatisfiable classes. \r\nI'm not sure if it would be sensible,\
      \ or for that matter how to, remove some terms in the uberon import? \r\nI'm\
      \ also not sure if it is an issue that CARO isn't compatible with CL and do\
      \ we have to chase down a reason? \r\nOr if it's just not worth it and we just\
      \ leave the dangling term? \r\nRelated to https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/1963 "

    - synonym is totally my fault - sorry about that, totally missed it. I've not
      really done alt_id though, always thought we just added item_replaced_by. But
      if its important to have alt_id we should have it in our docs.

      \ \r\nHowever note that it is difficult to search on the older term. I am wondering\
      \ if the key is to add the alt id, so that when I search on 2609, I get back\
      \ annotations that are using it? I can't tell at the moment. As for our in-house\
      \ interface, I put in a work order to try to replace all instances of 2609 with\
      \ the 0012 term. That request is being triaged now."
    - 'I think one lesson from this is that we should look in to keeping alt_ids as
      part of our merge system/SOPs to support legacy users. Broader OBO discussion:  should
      we make sure we have automated support for this (e.g. adding alt_ids automatically)?

    - Oh! Good question; this is actually in the CL import.
    - I transferred the issue from Uberon to CL.
    - This unusual IRI is in CL, but does have a label there, 'alobate nucleus'.

      \n\r\nThe CL has several similar \"CP:\" terms related to types of nuclei. I\
      \ should probably replace them all with something better (this has been brought\
      \ up multiple times).\r\n"

      \ these fake GO classes are actually in two namespaces:\r\n\r\n * CP\r\n * namespaceless\
      \ UUIDs\r\n\r\nI think we should get rid of the CPs, I don't know whether we\
      \ first want to turn the UUIDs into CPs"
    - This issue has not seen any activity in the past 6 months; it will be closed
      automatically in one year from now if no action is taken.

    comments:
    - These 'CP' terms were created years ago to capture cellular phenotypes.  The
      CP prefix has never been registered with OBO foundry, nor is there an actual
      CP ontology, though we once thought of doing one.  In retrospect, this is just
      an ugly hack, and I agree we should obsolete these terms and replace with terms
      from a more appropriate source, perhaps PATO.
    - "If they are cellular phenotypes, maybe we should align them with uPheno phenotypes\
      \ as well? Here three options:\r\n\r\n1. Obsolete all CP terms and replace by\
      \ fresh CL ids. Apply uPheno patterns instead of the now incompatible bearer-of\
      \ pattern.\r\n2. Move CP terms as they are to a new ontology called cellular\
      \ phenotype ontology. Use uPheno patterns. There are likely to emerge more cellular\
      \ phenotypes! \r\n3. Extent [CMPO](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cmpo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%2Fcmpo%2FCMPO_0000303).\
      \ I am not exactly sure, about worldview and biology issues, but wouldnt this\
      \ be a more suitable home?\r\n\r\n@addiehl @dosumis @simonjupp @cmungall "
    - "I'd be happy to split these terms into a separate, imported file - but I don't\
      \ think this would be a phenotype ontology.\r\n\r\nAll these terms are GO cell\
      \ components, subclassed by their qualities, so they might better be considered\
      \ as extensions to GO CC than phenotypes.  If they were made into phenotypes\
      \ following uPheno, then they couldn't fullfill their current role in defining\
      \ cell types  (at least not without a change in axiomatization). The one potentially\
      \ problematic case is 'increased nucleus size'. - as this appears to be  comparative\
      \ (and so more phenotype-y?).  However, looking at the definition, I think the\
      \ chosen quality is wrong:\r\n\r\n\"A nucleus size quality which is relatively\
      \ high compared to the amount of cytoplasm present in the same cell.\"\r\n\r\
      \nFrom this, it sounds like we need a new (categorical) PATO term, something\
      \ like:\r\n\r\n\"A quality inhering in a cell whose nuclear volume is relatively\
      \ high compared to the amount of cytoplasm present in the same cell.\" \r\n\r\
      \nWe could then use this to define the CP term, renames as something like 'oversized\
      \ nucleus'.\r\n\r\n@addiehl  - would that make sense to you?\r\n\r\nLonger term\
      \ - maybe they should just be requested as GO terms?"
    - "I believe these terms would be most appropriately moved to CMPO, since they\
      \ all describe cellular phenotypes that are observed via microscopy.\r\n\r\n\
      Does anyone actively maintain CMPO?"
    - "CMPO isn't in OBO. @matentzn @dosumis do you know if there is interest at EBI\
      \ in maintaining it?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.ebi.ac.uk/cmpo/\r\n\r\nor is this subsumed\
      \ by upheno? we could just put in as class expressions, no? original constraints\
      \ due to obof"
    - I think this is up to us. https://github.com/EBISPOT/CMPO has not been updated
      in a while, we could take it over, or do something else. Whatever works to maintain
      the concept of "cellular phenotypes" I guess!
    - Its not been subsumed by uPheno!
    - "we should think about modularization. is CMPO species neutral? what are its\n\
      boundaries with uPheno? Does it automatically subsume e.g. the majority of\n\
      FYPO (which is species specific, and inherently all \"cellular phenotypes\"\n\

    - "My intention was always to submit CMPO to OBO as an uber cellular phenotype\
      \ ontology. I tried to keep the modelling as close as possible to uPheno using\
      \ the SUBQ pattern. We were working with a bunch of phenotype observation from\
      \ a number of different microscopy datasets that all needed to be annotated\
      \ with pre-composed terms.  This meant we ended up with some strange terms like\
      \ this http://www.ebi.ac.uk/cmpo/CMPO_0000378, that isn't a cellular phenotype,\
      \ but an observation about a bunch of phenotypes in a population of cells. The\
      \ curators wanted these terms, but I was never really sure about how best to\
      \ handle these in a pre-composed way. \r\n\r\nI once did a little experiment\
      \ to see how much of FYPO I could classify beneath CMPO - with a bit of axiom\
      \ rewriting this kind of worked. It would be great to see some or all of CMPO\
      \ integrated into OBO and properly aligned with uPheno. "
    - "I don't think that a phenotype ontology is the right home for these classes.\
      \  Some relevant discussion on a closed ticket from late last year: https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/734#issuecomment-694964148\r\
      \n\r\nThese terms are used to define various cell types  - they typically refer\
      \ to entities rather than their qualities, e.g. see basophilic cytoplasm here:\r\
      \n\r\n```\r\n'basophilic erythroblast' EquivalentTo erythroblast \r\n  and ('has\
      \ part' some 'basophilic cytoplasm')\r\n  and ('has part' some heterochromatin)\
      \ \r\n  and ('has plasma membrane part' some 'transferrin receptor protein 1')\r\
      \n```\r\n\r\nI think a lot of this can be fixed by having the relevant qualities\
      \ in PATO.  I already made a ticket for these\r\n`'has part' some 'basophilic\
      \ cytoplasm'`\r\n->\r\n`'has part' some ('cytoplasm  and 'bearer of' some basophilic`)\
      \ # We could suggest these as types of cytoplasm in GO but a doubt they'd take\
      \ them.\r\n\r\nI already made a ticket for histological qualities in PATO: \
      \ https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/issues/342\r\n\r\nHere's the complete\
      \ list of CP terms:\r\n\r\n'acidophilic cytoplasm' http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000027\r\
      \n'banded nucleus' http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000039\r\n'basophilic\
      \ cytoplasm' http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000028\r\n'cartwheel heterochromatin'\
      \ http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000043\r\n'increased nucleus size' http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000037\r\
      \n'lobed nucleus' http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000025\r\n'neutrophillic\
      \ cytoplasm' http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000000\r\n'polychromatophilic\
      \ cytoplasm' http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000035\r\n'reniform nucleus'\
      \ http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CP_0000040\r\n\r\nThe only one that sounds\
      \ like a QE phenotype is 'increased nucleus size', but having looked into what\
      \ this is used for, I this is better expressed in terms of nuclear/cytoplasmic\
      \ ratio.  PATO ticket here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/issues/343.\
      \ (Nicole has already made a start at adding).\r\n\r\n"
    - "There are clearly phenotypes in CMPO which look like they could be useful here\
      \ - e.g. https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cmpo/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%2Fcmpo%2FCMPO_0000117&viewMode=All&siblings=false\r\
      \n\r\nBut it is not clear to me how we can use terms defined using QE to fill\
      \ slots in CL defs - whereas the EQ versions clearly do.\r\n\r\n"
    - "All agreed that we should fix following EQ (not QE) formalism as compound entity\
      \ - ask described above.\r\n\r\n  - [ ] Add all relevant terms to PATO\r\n \
      \ - [ ] Retofit."
    - "This issue is not solved, but for future reference, i propose to just get rid\
      \ of the CP namespace for now by incorporating the terms #1311 and you can deal\
      \ with the issue curation wise as you see fit when you get to it. I just want\
      \ to move the ID cleanup forward. \r\n\r\nSo, whoever takes this issue on: the\
      \ terms, in case #1311 gets merged, now have regular CL ids."
    - "I think we're close to solving it.   Needs:\r\n\r\n1. This PATO issue fixing:\
      \ https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/issues/342\r\n(These PATO terms have\
      \ already been added) https://github.com/pato-ontology/pato/commit/0ac2938138d4c8faeccf245d09bc78e14520844e)\r\
      \n\r\n2. Updates to CL terms that reference CP terms to change to compound entity\
      \ reference.\r\n"
    - "Actually - we might have most of the PATO terms already (I think they need\
      \ to be moved, but that's a secondary issue)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112839/141984447-55035bb8-46bc-4212-a8b6-563edf3c704f.png)\r\
      \n"
    - So all 10 CP terms will be obsoleted?
    - "@shawntanzk  - can you have a go at quickly cleaning this up.\r\n\r\nExample:\
      \ \r\n[acidophilic cytoplasm](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FCP_0000027)\r\

      \n\r\nEach should be changed to:\r\nhas_part some (cytoplasm and 'bearer of'*\
      \ some PATO:acidophilc) ...\r\n\r\n"
    - "> So all 10 CP terms will be obsoleted?\r\n\r\nThey can be obsoleted if we\
      \ replace all their usage with compound entities.  (If that doesn't cause unacceptable\
      \ problems with OBO product @addiehl  - do we need to continue to produce an\
      \ OBO product with intersection definitions, or will a simple, pre-reasoned,\
      \ relaxed OBO product be sufficient?)\r\n\r\n"
    - 'Added to agenda for tomorrow''s CL call '
    - I'll hold off making changes on this till after tomorrow's CL call discussing
      this - don't want to break OBO products before discussing how to handle it
    - "might also need a PATO release after new terms gets passed to fully complete\
      \ this \r\n"

  - in addition?
  - if we don't have the equiv axiom, the parent 'dendritic cell' and 'myeloid leukocyte'

  - Given the name, it totally makes sense for develops_from to be in the equivalence

    - I'll have to read a bit more about this - I have not seen enterocyte to be called
      _vacuolar_ absorptive cell in any of the papers I've seen though
    - Hi @paolaroncaglia - I went through various enterocyte papers and also tried
      searching for 'vacuolar absorptive cell' papers and mentions and I have never
      seen it used as a synonym or in relation to enterocytes (and certainly not in
      humans), so I would rather not have this term linked/synonymous with vacuolar
      absorptive cell, I'm not convinced it would be correct
    - "Hi @sfexova ,\r\nThank you for looking into the 'vacuolar absorptive cell vs.\
      \ enterocyte' issue above. Unfortunately, if I create 'enterocyte of colon'\
      \ in the way you requested, it will result equivalent to 'vacuolar absorptive\
      \ cell of epithelium of colon', and the automated ontology checks prevent this\
      \ type of duplication by throwing an error. I'll attach a screenshot of Protege\
      \ to show the equivalence. Basically, we need to clarify if the two terms are\
      \ really the same or not. If they are the same, 'vacuolar absorptive cell of\
      \ epithelium of colon' may be made a synonym of 'enterocyte of colon' if you\

      which it shouldn't be (and it would break the anatomograms) - can you please
      remove it from there?
    - "Hi @sfexova ,\r\nHm, I thought that had been fixed. I'll look into it (whether\
      \ the issue is in CL or Uberon), but I'm on leave today and tomorrow, so I re-opened\

      than it should be.  (@matentzn - another case that would be fixed by base file).

    - '@paolaroncaglia I haven''t finished the definition yet. Will work on it Monday'
    - 'Note for self: depends on https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/1762. '
    - "A nice older review article on lymph node germinal center structure is [PMID:8011279](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8011279/)\
      \ and should be used in addition to the book chapter which does not come with\
      \ proper citation details (ie, the URL could go dead without warning, although\
      \ it is a nice chapter).\r\n\r\nI think the primary term label should be 'lymph\
      \ node mantle zone B cell'.  We have to keep in mind that both the spleen and\
      \ tonsils have germinal centers with mantle zones, and this term should be specific\
      \ for this cell type in the lymph node.\r\n\r\nper comments in #1762, this cell\
      \ type should be 'part of' some 'lymph node follicular corona'\r\n\r\nAlso,\
      \ addressing Paola comment, because germinal center B cells occur in spleen\
      \ and tonsil as well as lymph node, we should not make 'germinal center B cell'\
      \ part of 'lymph node'.  If you want to create a lymph node specific subclass,\
      \ that could be part of the 'lymph node'.\r\n-- Alex"
    - Note to self, this will be easier to address when Uberon is released, as it'll
      have updates around mantle zone terms.
    - "Hi @ngeorgeebi (cc @sfexova ),\r\n\r\nThe new term is CL_0009037 (lymph node\
      \ mantle zone B cell).\r\nIt will be available with the next CL release, but\
      \ I'm not sure when that will be. The last release was on August 10th, so when\
      \ I've finished adding the remaining CL terms for SCA (hopefully next week),\
      \ I could ask for a new CL release.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nPaola"

      \ class 'neurosecretory cell of hypothalamus' with a logical \ndefinition (not\
      \ sure if there are other types...).\n\nWe could also include more specific\

  - change definition of CL:0000695 from 'One of a transient population of pioneering
    neurons in the cerebral cortex. These cells are slender bipolar cells of the developing
    marginal zone. One feature of these cells in mammals is that they express the
    Reelin gene.' to 'A neuron of the human embryonic marginal zone which display,
    as a salient feature, radial ascending processes that contact the pial surface,
    and a horizontal axon plexus located in the deep marginal zone. One feature of
    these cells in mammals is that they express the Reelin gene.'
  - create synonym 'CR cells' for CL:0000695
  - create synonym 'Horizontal cells of Cajal' for CL:0000695

    - "@sfexova \r\nYou requested 'enterocyte of colon'\r\nUberon has 'vacuolar absorptive\
      \ cell of epithelium of colon', equivalent to\r\n'enterocyte of epithelium of\
      \ large intestine' and ('part of' some 'colonic epithelium')\r\n(where 'colonic\
      \ epithelium' is part of colon)\r\nIs 'vacuolar absorptive cell of epithelium\

      \ so, \r\n- [ ] I'll add 'enterocyte of colon' as [broad?] synonym of 'vacuolar\
      \ absorptive cell of epithelium of colon'."
    - I'll have to read a bit more about this - I have not seen enterocyte to be called
      _vacuolar_ absorptive cell in any of the papers I've seen though
    - Hi @paolaroncaglia - I went through various enterocyte papers and also tried
      searching for 'vacuolar absorptive cell' papers and mentions and I have never
      seen it used as a synonym or in relation to enterocytes (and certainly not in
      humans), so I would rather not have this term linked/synonymous with vacuolar
      absorptive cell, I'm not convinced it would be correct
    - "Hi @sfexova ,\r\nThank you for looking into the 'vacuolar absorptive cell vs.\
      \ enterocyte' issue above. Unfortunately, if I create 'enterocyte of colon'\
      \ in the way you requested, it will result equivalent to 'vacuolar absorptive\
      \ cell of epithelium of colon', and the automated ontology checks prevent this\
      \ type of duplication by throwing an error. I'll attach a screenshot of Protege\
      \ to show the equivalence. Basically, we need to clarify if the two terms are\
      \ really the same or not. If they are the same, 'vacuolar absorptive cell of\
      \ epithelium of colon' may be made a synonym of 'enterocyte of colon' if you\
      \ prefer. If they are not the same, we need to establish where the difference\
      \ lies. Thank you. \r\n\r\n<img width=\"842\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2021-08-05 at\

      \ they are not called enterocytes (of xy) too? There's no reference and I have\

    - "@sfexova \r\nThe reference is [FMA:263114](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/fma/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FFMA_263114),\

    - yes, I meant there's no paper, so was wondering where FMA found the term...
    - "Hi @sfexova ,\r\nIs there any update on this issue, please? Would it be possible\
      \ to ask the external expert you referred to for other gut anatomogram terms,\

      \ the same for its sibling 'vacuolar absorptive cell of epithelium proper of\

      \ that the logical definition makes it clear that 'vacuolar absorptive cell\
      \ of epithelium of colon' and 'enterocyte of colon' are the same, and that we\
      \ could keep teh former as an exact synonym.\r\nPlease let me know so I can\
      \ address your request. Thanks!\r\nPaola"
    - "Hi @paolaroncaglia,\r\nI did quite an extensive search online but could not\
      \ find any paper or publication that would use the term 'vacuolar absorptive\
      \ cell', to me the terms seem a bit suspect and yes my preferred solution would\
      \ be to rename them both to enterocytes and I also agree that structured as\
      \ it is now in the ontology it follows that the 'vacuolar absorptive cells of\
      \ xy' (being children of 'enterocyte of large intestine' and having, in the\
      \ case of 'vacuolar absorptive cell of epithelium of colon', also 'enterocyte'\
      \ labelled child term) must themselves be enterocytes too, so should be safe\
      \ to rename. I personally think it would look better and be more consistent\
      \ if all the terms in this branch were named enterocytes, so if you can try\
      \ to do that - hopefully the other editors will agree - that would be fab!"
    - "Hi @sfexova ,\r\nThanks for your feedback. I'll check with a few other CL editors,\

      absorptive cell' as such is a term I've never seen used in any paper and it
      seems to me that not all enterocytes necessarily are 'vacuolar')

      which it shouldn't be (and it would break the anatomograms) - can you please
      remove it from there?
    - "Hi @sfexova ,\r\nHm, I thought that had been fixed. I'll look into it (whether\
      \ the issue is in CL or Uberon), but I'm on leave today and tomorrow, so I re-opened\
      \ the ticket and prioritized it, and I'll get back to you. Thanks."
    - "Looks like gut partonomy still needs fixing in Uberon:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112839/139824560-765a9852-d1b7-4213-a845-7e6b7508ef35.png)\r\

      with order of releases and stale imports that's making this harder to achieve
      than it should be.  (@matentzn - another case that would be fixed by base file).

      \ it be revised to part_of 'anorectum'?\r\nOr is the term no longer needed?\r\
      \nThanks,\r\nPaola"
    - Hi @paolaroncaglia, thanks - it is still needed, yes. This type of cell only
      appears in the anal canal, not in the rest of the large intestine, so it can
      stay as stratified squamous epithelial cell of anal canal without breaking anything
      I believe

    - I think if we keep terms in CL we need to do a good job of ensuring **reasonable
      completeness**. If we can't commit to doing this for somatic cell let's get
      rid of it, it's confusing as it is now as it is so incomplete
    - "Notes from CL call:\r\n  - No one gave an especially strong argument for keeping\
      \ the term so we suggest obsoletion.  However, before obsoletion we should check\
      \ completely for any usage in other ontologies (follow links to usage context\
      \ here: http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/CL?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FCL_0002371\

    - "Prostate neuroendocrine are rare and sometimes difficult to identify unless\
      \ you are specifically looking for them. That paper did not identify them as\
      \ it wasn't important for proving their hypothesis. They are usually referred\
      \ to in publications in reference to prostate cancer, which can trans-differentiate\
      \ into neuroendocrine-like prostate cancer... but they are present in the normal\
      \ prostate and is very well accepted in the urologic field as being present.\r\
      \n\r\nThe review [pmc8023015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/pmc8023015/)\
      \ describes them as:\r\n> NE cells are scattered among the more abundant luminal\
      \ and basal cells, representing only \u223C1% of the epithelial population.11,\
      \ 13, 21 Because of their rarity in benign prostate and most prostate tumors,\
      \ they cannot be appreciated on standard H&E stained sections. However, through\
      \ the use of electron microscopy, they can be identified and differentiated\
      \ from luminal and basal cells by their elongated cell bodies and intracytoplasmic\
      \ dense core secretory granules.21 Furthermore, electron microscopy can differentiate\
      \ between two morphologic subtypes of NE cells: open-type and closed-type.24\
      \ Open-type cells possess long microvilli which reach the lumen and can detect\
      \ changes in pH as well as respond to other chemical stimuli in luminal secretions.\
      \ Closed-type cells possess dendritic-like processes and receive stimuli from\
      \ nerve endings, blood vessels, and smooth muscle cells. A more practical way\
      \ to highlight NE cells in the prostatic epithelium involves the use of immunohistochemistry\
      \ (IHC) (Fig. 1) and commonly used markers include chromogranin A (CgA),11,\
      \ 13, 21 synaptophysin (SYP),11, 13, 21 neuron-specific enolase (NSE),11, 13,\
      \ 21 neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM or CD56),11, 13, 21 forkhead-box A2\
      \ (FOXA2),25 and CXC chemokine receptor 2 (CXCR2).26 In addition to being negative\
      \ for AR and PSA, they are also negative for Ki67 because they are non-proliferative,\
      \ post-mitotic cells.11, 13, 21, 26\r\n\r\n...as a matter of fact, it even describes\
      \ two types (open-type and closed-type) which I have never heard about.\r\n"

    - Are you sure you can't be more precise about whether the lymphocyte is a T cell
      or B cell?  It really is not helpful just to identify cells as lymphocytes.  Do
      you have any marker or functional information?
    - "Hi @ngeorgeebi ,\r\nWe discussed this request on today's CL and Uberon editors'\
      \ call. I presented the anatomograms use case, and SCA's need for grouping terms\
      \ based on anatomical location. While it's easier to justify the creation of\
      \ several other CL and Uberon terms you and @sfexova requested recently, @addiehl\
      \ is more concerned about lymphocite and lymph node-related classes. Ideally,\
      \ given the amount of literature and evidence for these areas, we'd want to\
      \ provide more detail than what you have currently. It'd be a better service\
      \ to the community including your users. I understand that it may not be possible\
      \ to modify most of the anatomograms that you already have, but for lymphocite\
      \ and lymph node-related requests alone, could you please review them and see\
      \ if you could use more granular terms? E.g. as Alex suggested\r\n \r\n> Are\
      \ you sure you can't be more precise about whether the lymphocyte is a T cell\
      \ or B cell? It really is not helpful just to identify cells as lymphocytes.\
      \ Do you have any marker or functional information?\r\n\r\nHere we could also\
      \ create two classes (medullary T cell + medullary B cell) if you can use/locate\

      \ more explicitly in new term(s), e.g. \"do not use for annotation\" if the\

      \ the term will be used in an anatomogram. (Moved to #1165 .)"
    - Also, I would like to point out that there are medullas/medullae in other organs,
      such as the thymus or the brain (medulla oblongata), and therefore new classes
      in the CL for T cells and B cells of the lymph node medulla should be called
      some like 'T cell of the lymph node medulla' and 'B cell of the lymph node medulla'
      so that the anatomical location of these cells is not ambiguous.
    - 'Thanks @addiehl and @paolaroncaglia for the feedback here! This is unfortunately
      a really generalised term but I would actually assume a mix of B and T lymphocytes
      located in the medullary sinus of the lymph node. These would be a range of
      activated lymphocytes on their way back out of the lymph node via the efferent
      vesicles - but i can definitely see where you guys are coming from! I was mostly
      wondering what would be the best way to represent this term. Also as in discussion
      with @paolaroncaglia, the issue came up that we are trying to find stationary
      terms for non-stationary entities, which is very difficult. Our aim for the
      anatomograms is to represent this cells in the most versatile way so users can
      a. find the cell type in the anatomograms and b. use this to anotate their terms
      when providing inferred cell type. If as I am assuming would be the best way
      forward is to sidestep the term lympocyte entirely and create the two terms:
      B cell of medullary sinus of lymph node and T cell of medullary sinus of lymph
      node then this would be a good compromise for us if it works for you as well
      :)'
    - I would be happy with 'B cell of medullary sinus of lymph node' and 'T cell
      of medullary sinus of lymph node'.
    - Thank you @addiehl and @paolaroncaglia I think that should work well :) . Should
      I make the two new term requests?

    - It seems that _neurogliaform_ is more common than _neuroglioform_, and a quick
      ngram confirms this, so I'm fine with the change. I wonder if the difference
      between 'glia' and 'glio' in this label is due to the Greek root of the term
      occurring with/without an 'o' in English ('gloia'/'glia'). I suppose it doesn't
      matter.

    - This issue has not seen any activity in the past 6 months; it will be closed
      automatically in one year from now if no action is taken.
    - Commenting to remove Stale tag - this will probably not make it into CL but
      rather into pCL when BDS side has worked that out. Would like to leave this
      here so that I don't forget about it
    - Happy to add to CL but without the PVALB like.

    - '@ngeorgeebi hi Nancy! I just recently added a general term for "intestinal

      intestine"](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FCL_0002203)
      -- do you think "tuft cell of large intestine" could be a synonym of this?'
    - "Hi @mkeays sounds good! I noticed that CL term too :) apologies I hadn't realised\
      \ at the time. I did make a comment above thinking exactly the same as you suggested\
      \ so great that we are on the same page!:\r\nngeorgeebi commented 3 days ago\r\
      \ncould instead add these terms as synonym to brush cell of epithelium proper\
      \ of large intestine http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CL_0002203 \r\n\r\nWould\
      \ be happy to see these added as synonyms. Thanks!"
    - Hi @ngeorgeebi , ahh sorry, I missed your comment! OK great, I can add the synonyms
      to the existing term then I think -- @paolaroncaglia do you think that sounds
      OK?
    - "Hi @ngeorgeebi and @mkeays ,\r\n \r\nIf Nancy\u2019s requested \u2018tuft cell\
      \ of large intestine\u2019 is indeed located in the intestinal epithelium, as\
      \ Nancy\u2019s suggested synonyms suggest, then I agree that \u2018tuft cell\
      \ of large intestine\u2019 could be a synonym of the existing term CL_0002203\
      \ \u2018brush cell of epithelium proper of large intestine\u2019. \r\n\r\nThis\
      \ said, looking at the whole \u2018brush cell\u2019 node, and considering Nancy\u2019\
      s request for \u2018tuft cell of small intestine\u2019 https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/791,\
      \ I\u2019d suggest the following edits:\r\n\r\n- [ ] If possible, add some gloss\
      \ to the definition of \u2018brush cell\u2019. It is currently \u201CA cell\
      \ type found in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts that is characterized\
      \ by the presence of a tuft of blunt, squat microvilli (120-140 per cell). Function\
      \ of this cell type is not known.\u201D This is from 2010 so I wonder if we\
      \ could say something about function now?\r\n\r\n- [ ] If the above can be addressed,\
      \ then we could remove this bit from the def of its child \u2018brush cell of\
      \ trachebronchial tree\u2019\u201D \u201C\u2026Function not known.\u201D.\r\n\
      \r\n- [ ] Are brush cells located in bronchus or trachea ever referred to as\
      \ \u201Ctuft cells\u201D in the literature? If yes, we should ensure that 'brush\
      \ cell of trachebronchial tree\u2019, 'brush cell of bronchus\u2019, 'brush\
      \ cell of lobular bronchiole\u2019, \u2018'brush cell of terminal bronchiole\u2019\
      , and 'brush cell of trachea' all have synonyms containing the \u201Ctuft\u201D\
      \ wording.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Maria wrote in her ticket on \u2019intestinal tuft cell\u2019\
      \ (https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/780): \u201CCL has a\
      \ general brush cell and brush cell of epithelium proper of large intestine\
      \ but no general intestinal brush cell. Brush cells found in small and large\
      \ intestine seem to be called \"tuft cells\" rather than \"brush cells\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuft_cell).\
      \ They share some characteristics, such as marker proteins, so it would be good\
      \ to have one that was not limited to large intestine.\u201D. It\u2019d be nice\
      \ to clarify that in the definition, i.e. why the label has tuft instead of\
      \ brush (and xref the Wikipedia entry version), and also if possible some gloss\
      \ to clarify what differentiates intestinal tuft cells from generic tuft/brush\
      \ cells please. Perhaps also use Nancy\u2019s suggestion: \u201CAny brush cell\
      \ that is part of the intestinal epithelium. [In what species is the following\
      \ known?] Intestinal tuft cells represent approximately 0.5% of gut epithelial\
      \ cells depending on location.\u201D and add xref PMID:29714721.\r\n\r\n- [\
      \ ] If Maria is confident that the primary label should refer to tuft instead\
      \ of brush for intestinal types, then the label of CL_0002203 \u2018brush cell\
      \ of epithelium proper of large intestine\u2019 should be changed to \u2018\
      tuft cell of epithelium proper of large intestine\u2019 (keep \u2018brush cell\
      \ of epithelium proper of large intestine\u2019 as an exact synonym). Also,\
      \ the following annotations should be added to CL_0002203 from Nancy\u2019s\

    - Hi @paolaroncaglia , thanks so much for the detailed review. It all sounds good
      to me, if you don't mind doing the edits that would be great! From what I read
      it seemed to me that people tended to use "tuft cell" when talking about intestinal
      populations, and "brush cell" when talking about those in the respiratory tract,
      but there is some crossover. There was some suggestion that they have chemosensory
      function in what I briefly read, but I would have to research further to fully
      understand what is now known about these cells.
    - "Are brush cells in the intestine cells with the GO cellular component \"brush\
      \ border\" GO:0005903 ?  If so lower vertebrates don't usually call them tuft\
      \ cells.  They call them \"brush border\" cells.   In zebrafish researchers\
      \ refer, very occasionally, to neuroepithilal cells in olfactory organ as tufted\
      \ cells.   We seem to have very similar cells in the columnar/cuboidal epithelial\
      \ cell tree we have \r\n\r\n brush border epithelial cell\r\n  -  enterocyte\r\
      \n\r\n- - enterocyte of epithelium of duodenal gland\r\n\r\n- - enterocyte of\
      \ epithelium of large intestine\r\n\r\n\r\n- - enterocyte of epithelium of small\
      \ intestine\r\n\r\nOr would \"Tuft cell\" be a specialized type of enterocyte?\r\
      \n\r\n          \r\n\r\n \r\n            \r\n            \r\n-          \r\n\
      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
    - "From a quick naive look at Wikipedia:  looks like tuft cells are chemosensory\
      \ cells (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuft_cell) distinct from the brush border\
      \ cells (entorcytes? )https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brush_border.\r\n\r\nIf\

    - Meis2 is a highlight distinct GABAergic type.  It is so distinct that it often

      Tuft cell that is a part of a vermiform appendix. Intestinal tuft cells are\
      \ a morphologically unique cell type, best characterized by striking microvilli\
      \ that form an apical tuft. They are known to express express chemosensory receptors.\

    - "Hi @sfexova ,\r\n\r\nI added CL_0009020 (tuft cell of appendix). It will be\
      \ available with the next CL release. There isn't a set date yet, but I'll push\
      \ for a release soon (ideally after I've added a few more cell types for you\
      \ and @ngeorgeebi ).\r\nOn a general note, the definitions you provided for\
      \ each \u201Cx cell of appendix\u201D term describe what x cells and appendix\
      \ are, but we don\u2019t need to repeat those descriptions as they can be looked\
      \ via the parent terms. So I didn\u2019t include those descriptions, and kept\
      \ only the generic pattern definition \u201CAn x cell that is part of a vermiform\
      \ appendix\u201D (except where a specific description was included). Similarly,\
      \ most of the PMIDs you provided refer to the x cells, and are not specific\
      \ to x cells in the context of appendix, so I didn\u2019t include them unless\
      \ they were in fact specific and informative for the new term.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\

  - 'Just curious, are there any non-excitatory glutamatergic neurons or are all glutamatergic
    neurons excitatory? '
  - 'Honestly, I am not entirely sure. My undergrad knowledge wants to say yes, but
    at the same time I know that not all glutamate receptors for example are excitatory
    (like mGluRs) though that doesn''t mean glut neurons arent excitatory. Glutamate
    can also be inhibitory in some cases (https://www.pnas.org/content/110/25/10294),
    though again, that does not necessarily mean that glutamate neurons themselves
    arent excitatory. Tried searching up on this and cant seem to get a direct answer
    too. I think they might be, but I am 100% sure that every single instance of a
    glutamatergic neuron is excitatory. (might also be overthinking this) '
  - "Interesting -- I thought that every glutamatergic neuron was excitatory, but\
    \ I'm no expert. \r\n\r\nI was curious because 'excitatory' occurs in this definition\
    \ and I was wondering if it was redundant, i.e., if all glutamatergic neurons\
    \ are excitatory, then there's no need to specify that this class of glutamatergic\
    \ neurons are also excitatory. "

    - '@jeremymiller - we''re a bit stuck on this one.  Could you help clarify?'
    - Meis2 is a highlight distinct GABAergic type.  It is so distinct that it often
      (as in this case) shows up in the dendrogram outside the scope of the rest of
      the neurons.

  - "oh that makes more sense, i was wondering about that, thought it was some derived\
    \ inference sort of situation. \r\nCurrently they are species neutral, but I guess\
    \ I should not add the markers in given that they were from mouse data. I've already\
    \ added mesothelial fibroblast, but will add one specific to the leptomeninx under\
    \ it. Happy to add a non species specific without the marker information, and\
    \ add makers in another species specific entry. I'll also find better references.\
    \ \r\n\r\nThings to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove comment \r\n- [x] Create mesothelial\
    \ fibroblast of the leptomeninx & organise accordingly\r\n- [x] Remove markers\
    \ from non species-specific term \r\n- [x] Create species-specific entries and\
    \ add above markers to them instead\r\n- [x] Fix references\r\n\r\n"
  - '@dosumis think I fixed it - would like a review of it. Thanks'
  - Make part of arachnoid mater?  Also simplify def and make sure it doesn't duplicate
    def of tissue it is part of.  TO push this through, split out ABC to separate
    PR.
  - Make this equivalentTo => autoclassification of of VLMC rather than asserted.

  - Please make tickets for spindle component 'nuclear chain fiber' and 'nuclear bag

  - Something odd going on here with diffs.  Ignore for now as may disappear.
  - 'Yeah, I noticed it too, but it seems to add it back too? So I guess it''s fine? '
  - not sure what this is? should this be removed?
  - (this came in when I fixed the conflict, btw)

    - "@anjaf \r\nThanks, this cell type indeed seems to be absent form CL. However,\
      \ I'm not sure if CL would be keen on importing from BTO, and the BTO term you\
      \ suggest is ~10 years old. I'd rather create a new CL term and xref BTO. @dosumis\
      \ any objection please?\r\nNotes for self: could use https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olfactory_ensheathing_cell,\
      \ but may also need clarification directly from the literature (the Wikipedia\
      \ entry seems to imply equivalence between macroglia and radial glia, not sure\
      \ about that). The original paper on OECs is likely https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23862023/."
    - I agree that creating a new term in CL is probably a better choice, with an
      xref to BTO.  The term should have better references than wikipedia and COPE
      (which is now behind a paywall), and may benefit from an improved definition.
    - "@nicolevasilevsky Thank you for adding that term! Is the plan still to try\
      \ and aim for a CL release around the 10th of each month, please? \r\n\r\n@anjaf\

    - If the term is in the scatlas seed (zooma file) and the current CL release,
      it will be integrated into the scAtlas ontology build. No additional steps needed.
    - 'Thanks for creating the term @paolaroncaglia! Yes as David said, no other action

      \n\r\nFor @ValWood's  purposes there can't be any existential link to a term\
      \ excluded from fission yeast. I think we should consider whether `'multicellular\
      \ organismal process' never_in_taxon 'Schizosaccharomyces pombe'` is really\
      \ valid."
    - "Surely this is a GO problem?   I don't like the idea that perfectly valid axioms\
      \ need to be deleted from CL because they conflict with GO build issues. This\
      \ could bite us in other cases where we make links to GO.  If I understand the\
      \ issue correctly, it could also cause problems in other situations where we\
      \ use the same strategy for creating taxon subsets.\r\n"
    - "> Surely this is a GO problem?\r\n\r\nI agree, probably so, or at least we\
      \ need to decide which is wrong:\r\n- `'germ cell' SubclassOf 'capable of' some\

      \ organismal reproductive process'`\r\n-> change to capable of' some 'reproductive\
      \ process'`? \r\n\r\nThanks, Pascale"
    - It looks like germ cell already has the SubClass Of (Anonymous Ancestor) 'capable
      of' some 'reproductive process', and therefore gamete does too. So maybe removing
      the SubClass Of axiom from 'germ cell' is maybe okay, if what we want is for
      'germ cell' to have the axiom 'capable of' some 'reproductive process'?
    - 'As far as GO is concerned, we would like to see the multicellular organism
      aspect removed. Reproduction is fine. '
    - "I don't see any harm in doing this.  But I'd really like a better understanding\
      \ of the problem.  We should be able to state this as a simple set of biologically\
      \ meaningful statements that together => a contradiction.  What minimal set\
      \ of assertions do we need to add to these to tell that complete story:\r\n\r\
      \n- `'germ cell' SubclassOf 'capable of' some 'multicellular organismal reproductive\
      \ process'` (CL)\r\n- `'multicellular organismal process' never_in_taxon 'Schizosaccharomyces\
      \ pombe'` (GO)\r\n\r\n?\r\n"

      \ this indicates a wider problem we should be aware of.\r\n\r\nI don't want\
      \ to hold up your edits though, if there's a solution to this particular problem\

    - Yep. Seen that.  It's what worries me.   Maybe I should just have a chat with
      Jim offline so I can understand properly. For the fix, would you be happy with
      us using a more specific term that does not come with an inference of multicellularity?
    - "@dosumis  that was the resolution . I'm not using the polyspermy term. A new\

      pyramidal cell

      Pyramidal neurons have a pyramid-shaped soma with the apex and an apical dendrite
      pointed toward the pial surface and other dendrites and an axon emerging from
      the base. The axons may have local collaterals but also project outside their
      region. Pyramidal neurons are found in the cerebral cortex, the hippocampus,
      and the amygdala. [database_cross_reference: GOC:tfm][database_cross_reference:

      \ a lot of progenitor cells (e.g. CL_0000038, https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cl/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FCL_0000038)\

      \ cell, has a tendency to differentiate into a specific type of cell, but is\
      \ already more specific than a stem cell and is pushed to differentiate into\
      \ its \"target\" cell,\" (Lawrence, B.E.; Horton, P.M. (2013). Progenitor Cells\u202F\
      : Biology, Characterization and Potential Clinical Applications. Nova Science\

      \ cells, only they are more constrained in their differentiation potential or\

    - we've made some progress on it. Can you re-run the report so we can see what

      Maybe the best approach would be to add text defs via patterns, where possible?"
    - Oh, it actually looks like I started doing that, in this [tab](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bcu6O5hgqAxTMcha_pDv4yZCQ8kTlMiLlb8o4b_2He0/edit#gid=308594775)
    - I think patterns will work for many of these, but not all.  Many of these go
      back to the original CL, and for some the intended meaning may be indiscernible.
    - Agreed- doing a quick look now, and some definitely conform to pattern, and
      there may be some that I can't figure out what they are, like CL:0000204 acceleration
      receptive cell. May be a candidate for obsoletion.

    - I'll add this to the CL meeting agenda. It is going to be a lot of work to add
      definitions to all of these terms, even if we use patterns.

      \ gloss and/or an rdfs:comment added to clarify the above? \r\nAre there reasons\
      \ not to add the link 'follicular cell of ovary' part of 'ovarian follicle'?\r\
      \n\r\nThanks,\r\nPaola"
    - This ticket was originally assigned to @nicolevasilevsky , but perhaps @gouttegd
      and/or @dosumis would like to comment re. Diptera. Thanks in advance!
    - "In obophenotype/uberon#1524, @dosumis suggested that the two terms (`follicular\
      \ cell of ovary` and `ovarian follicle cell`) could be merged as they appeared\
      \ to be duplicates. It is true that, strictly within CL, the two terms are redundant.\r\
      \n\r\nHowever, I do note that we have in Uberon two distinct terms to refer\
      \ to the mammalian follicle (`ovarian follicle`, UBERON:0001305) and the insect\
      \ follicle a.k.a egg chamber (`egg chamber`, UBERON:0003199). While `egg chamber`\
      \ has been marked as \u201Ccandidate for obsoletion\u201D, I actually think\
      \ that it should be retained since `ovarian follicle` is a bit too specific\
      \ to cover the case of non-mammalian follicles (e.g., it has a `has_part some\
      \ 'follicular fluid'`, which I don\u2019t think would be correct for insect\
      \ follicles). And if we have two terms in Uberon for the follicles themselves,\
      \ it kind of makes sense to have two terms as well in CL to refer to the corresponding\
      \ cells.\r\n\r\nTherefore I would agree with @dosumis \u2019s _other_ suggestion\
      \ in obophenotype/uberon#1524, which is to rename `ovarian follicle cell` (CL:0000477)\
      \ to `follicle cell of egg chamber`. Coupled with the taxon rules suggested\
      \ above (CL:0000477 restricted to _Diptera_ and CL:0002174 excluding _Diptera_),\
      \ and either a mention in the text definition or a comment, this should help\
      \ distinguish between the two terms as requested.\r\n\r\n(It would then optionally\
      \ be possible to add a new, more generic term for \u201Cfollicle cell\u201D\
      \ encompassing both the mammalian one and the insect one, with the definition\
      \ suggested (again) by @dosumis: \u201Can epithelial somatic cell associated\
      \ with a maturing oocyte\u201D, which as far as I know is valid for all follicle\
      \ cells regardless of species.)\r\n\r\nI can take care of implementing this\
      \ proposal if we agree on it."

    - This involved a larger set of changes, including redefining 'memory T cell',
      'CD4-positive memory T cell', and 'CD8-positive memory T cell' in a phenotypic
      and functional manner to be broadly applicable across species, and creating
      'CD4-positive memory T cell, CD45RO-positive' 9CL;0001204) and 'CD8-positive
      memory T cell, CD45RO-positive' (CL:0001203) human specific terms with taxon
      restrictions. 'effector memory CD8-positive, alpha-beta T cell, terminally differentiated'
      was also provided a new definition as described previously with a human taxon
      restriction, and 'memory CCR4-positive regulatory T cell' also received a human
      taxon restriction based on its makers.

      due to morphology.    They are secretory epidermal cells.

      lung macrophage\u2019 (\u201CCirculating macrophages and tissue macrophages\
      \ (alveolar macrophages) of lung\u201D), CL:0000583 \u2018alveolar macrophage\u2019\

      \ additional parent CL:0000122 \u2018stellate neuron\u2019 (they also both lack\
      \ a definition, see e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellate_cell).\r\n-\
      \ [x] CL:0009005 \u2018salivary gland cell\u2019 should be given a part_of axiom\
      \ to UBERON:0001044 \u2018saliva-secreting gland\u2019. There are missing links\
      \ between \u2018salivary gland cell\u2019 and CL terms that are part_of children\
      \ or descendants of \u2018saliva-secreting gland\u2019; adding the axiom above\
      \ should fix that. \r\n\r\n\r\nSynonyms:\r\n\r\n- [x] CL:0000815 \u2018regulatory\
      \ T cell\u2019 doesn\u2019t have the synonym \u201CTreg\u201D, commonly used\
      \ in the literature. \u201CTreg\u201D is in CL as a broad synonym, or as part\
      \ of synonyms, of subtypes of regulatory T cells. I\u2019d suggest adding \u201C\
      Treg\u201D as a synonym to CL:0000815 \u2018regulatory T cell\u2019.\r\n\r\n\
      \r\nTypos:\r\n\r\n- [x] The labels of CL:0002147 \u2018clear chief cell of parathyroid\
      \ cell\u2019 and CL:0002143 \u2018dark chief cell of parathyroid cell\u2019\
      \ should both probably be corrected to \u2018...gland\u2019.\r\n- [x] For consistency\
      \ with other types of brush cells, the label of CL:0002203 \u2018Brush cell\
      \ of epithelium proper of large intestine\u2019 should probably be \u2018brush\u2026\
      \u2019.\r\n- [x] CL:0002265 \u2018type D cell of colon\u2019 has a synonym \u201C\
      colonc delta cell\u201D, this is probably a typo for \u201Ccolonic\u2026\u201D\
      . \r\n- [x] The label of CL:1000323 \u2018pylroric gastric gland goblet cell\u2019\
      \ should be corrected to \u201Cpyloric\u2026\u201D.\r\n- [x] The definition\
      \ of CL:0002051 \u2018CD38-high pre-BCR positive cell\u2019 reads \u201CA pre-BCR\
      \ positive T cell that is CD38-high.\u201D but should probably read \u201C...positive\
      \ B cell\u2026\u201D based on its parentage.\r\n- [x] CL:0000171 \u2018pancreatic\

      \ and basal vascular plants, but was overcome in seed plants by the dispersal\
      \ of pollen and the guided delivery of _non-motile sperm_ to the female gametes.**\
      \ Here we discuss the evolutionary history of male gametogenesis in streptophytes\
      \ (green plants) and the underlying developmental biology, including recent\
      \ advances in bryophyte and  angiosperm models. We conclude with a perspective\
      \ on research trends that promise to deliver a deeper understanding of the evolutionary\
      \ and developmental mechanisms of male gametogenesis in plants.\r\n> \r\n\r\n\

    - "Thank you for identifying this issue in CL\r\n\r\nIt's actually worse as CL\
      \ asserts it's an animal cell:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50745/67039696-b1502d00-f0d6-11e9-8e89-21989d4fb8bf.png)\r\
      \n\r\nWhile the focus of CL is metazoa, there is a need for an ontology to hold\
      \ general groupings that span wider groups.\r\n\r\nAlso CL should strive to\
      \ use language that does not cause confusion. Calling something \"sperm\" that\
      \ is more specific than the label suggests is an anti-pattern. (note that we\
      \ can always have taxon-specific synonyms for a more mammalian centric subclass\
      \ if we like)\r\n\r\nI propose \r\n\r\n 1. that we remove the linkage between\
      \ GLC and animal cell (and review what is currently under animal cell). In fact\
      \ I question the utility of animal cell and eukaryotic cell. These predate TCs.\r\
      \n 2. we remove the logical definition from CL sperm cell (this is a bad definition\
      \ in any case by the criteria I laid down in https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/07/29/ontotip-dont-over-specify-owl-definitions/\
      \ and https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/07/08/ontotip-write-simple-concise-clear-operational-textual-definitions/).\
      \ We could make them taxon GCIs but I question the utility\r\n 3. We add subclasses\
      \ provided by Karen\r\n\r\nCan @obophenotype/cell-ontology editors indicate\
      \ agreement/disagreement\r\n"
    - So how do cilia and nematode sperm fit in to this picture?
    - Nematode sperm do not have a flagellum. They are ameboid. There is also an issue
      here if we want to include plants. If I recall correctly from my days as a developmental
      biologist, plants do not segregate their germ line (see the graph above). Comments
      from @tberardini  or @vanaukenk might be helpful here.
    - Does movement by pseudopod count as ameboid? In which case C.elegans sperm classified
      as ameboid sperm (from PMID:29879100).  Peraps worth ading motile and non-motile
      sibling classes.
    - See this paper PMID:19295707
    - "> Peraps worth ading motile and non-motile sibling classes.\r\n\r\nI think\
      \ that's a good idea. It seems to me that in order to make an equivalence axiom\
      \ for the GO term 'sperm cell motility', it would be better to use a CL term\
      \ 'motile sperm cell' rather than just 'sperm cell' since the latter isn't necessarily\
      \ motile. So that would modify my earlier suggestion to this:\r\n\r\n-- sperm\
      \ cell\r\n--- motile sperm cell\r\n---- amoeboid sperm cell\r\n---- flagellated\
      \ sperm cell\r\n--- non-motile sperm cell"
    - is there action needed on this ticket?
    - We need a release so we can import the new terms.
    - I think this can be closed, please reopen if needed.
