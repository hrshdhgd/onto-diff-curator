    issue_title: add synonym "hindlimb zeugopod skin" to "lower leg skin" UBERON:0004264
  pr_comments:
  - Thank you Paula, I can't see the usage of this synonym in the reference you have
    provided. Could it be the wrong PMID?
  - '@aleixpuigb thank you Aleix for reviewing. Yes, you are right. We just realized
    that hindlimb zeugopod skin was missing while integrating in Cellosaurus cell
    lines described in PMID:11943340 (but the term is not described in that paper).
    I will remove this reference but I do not have any other to add. Should I add
    my ORCID or leave it empty? Sorry for the confusion'
  - I think adding your ORCID is enough in this case, thank you!

    - It does seem to be missing. It may be because I wanted to use "maxilla" rather
      than "upper jaw region".
    - "I have been doing some research, and from what I could find, the maxilla holds\
      \ the teeth, but teeth are not part of it. We might be able to find a different\
      \ object property for maxilla and maintain the same pattern as the other molar\

    - Yes please left and right.  I know generally this is frowned upon, but in cases
      where an organ has laterality and some differences, it seems warranted.  Kidney
      and lung makes sense for laterality. Thanks

      \ and the inner layer that develops specific periderm granules. Both layers\

    - "Yes, add is_a outer epithelium makes sense.\r\nWhat part of the definition\
      \ gives you pause yet?  My main issue initially was the equating it with adult\
      \ when it was embryonic. \r\nThis was your proposed change: \r\n**New definition:**\r\
      \nThe outermost layer (or layers, depending on the species) of embryonic skin\

      \ functions. The periderm derive from the outer layer of the ectoderm.[PMID:35582825](https://doi.org/10.1111/exd.14608),\
      \ PMID:[25133425](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25133425)\r\nThank you for\
      \ the EVL related synonym. "
    - "> What part of the definition gives you pause yet?\r\n\r\nSorry, I meant the\
      \ definition of [outer epithelium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0007376),\
      \ since it is an exact synonym of epidermis and it is used interchangeably in\
      \ the definition. Probably it should be changed to be broader?"
    - "Because the original uberon term was a mix of embryo terminology and adult\
      \ organism terminology, I think this is the problem still. \r\nPeriderm refers\
      \ to the outer epithelial layer which is ectoderm.  It should not be equated\
      \ with epidermis which is also why the original stratum corneum of epidermis\
      \ did not make sense to be associated--that's an adult organism term."
    - Exactly, therefore outer epithelium synonyms and definitions should be edited.

  - Could these Wikipedia references be in another annotation, like xref, for terms
    without a definition?
  - "Yes, I suppose they could be xrefs or seeAlso. Is that really necessary, though?\
    \ We\u2019re talking about _obsolete_ terms after all. The only reason someone\
    \ is ever going to look at them is if they have been using them in their own ontologies\
    \ or databases and they need to know how to replace them \u2013 and for that they\
    \ will be looking at `consider` tags, not xrefs or anything else."
  - We never know. If we can keep the information, it's always better.
  - "Fine, if it\u2019s make you happy.\r\n\r\nI believe that keeping information\
    \ for the sake of keeping information is utterly ridiculous, though. There\u2019\
    s a difference between \u201Ckeeping information\u201D and keeping all the crap\

  pr_comments:
  - Why are these and the other 61 xrefs removed?
  - this is a bit hacky compared to `sssom parse` - you prefer less depency on sssom-py
    at the moment due to zero versioning I presume?
  - I cant judge these changes so I assume you have them under control :)
  - They're on the sssom tsv file now.
  - "Yep, so in the end they end up in the `components/mappings.owl` component, so\
    \ they don\u2019t need to be in the `-edit` file anymore."
  - "No, `sssom-py` is already included in the ODK anyway, so that is not the problem.\r\
    \n\r\nThe problem is that `sssom-py` is just excruciatingly slow, sorry. Just\
    \ assembling a single YAML+TSV file (which is necessary because `sssom dosql`\
    \ cannot use a mapping set with non-embedded metadata) takes (on my machine) 20\
    \ seconds:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ time sssom parse -I tsv biomappings.sssom.tsv -m\
    \ biomappings.sssom.yml -o combined-biomappings.sssom.tsv\r\n21.57s user 0.25s\
    \ system 107% cpu 20.334 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen filtering out everything that\
    \ is not relevant for Uberon takes 30 more seconds:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ time sssom\
    \ dosql -Q \"SELECT * FROM df1 WHERE (subject_id LIKE 'UBERON:%' OR object_id\
    \ LIKE 'UBERON:%')\" -o filtered.sssom.tsv combined.sssom.tsv\r\n28.24s user 0.68s\

  - Yes but you are trading an opportunity for standardising a workflow using a hack;
    there is a cost in that too; for example, there is a risk that the two pieces
    "don't fit together" (curie map is outdated etc), and you would never know. Its
    also less maintainable because there are 100 ways of doing this, and everyone
    could be doing it slightly differently creating cognitive overhead. I am not saying
    your judgement is wrong, I am just saying it that I would not consider it right
    to say that "runtime" is the only factor, and there are no tradeoffs.

    \ or language-level operation to filter these as a pre-processing in a robust\
    \ fashion.\u201D)\r\n\r\n2. It's a _temporary_ hack until the next ODK version\
    \ is available. As I said above, the next ODK will natively include my `sssom-cli`\
    \ tool, which will allow to perform the desired operations (catenating the metadata\
    \ and the mappings themselves, and filtering the non-Uberon mappings) in a completely\
    \ \u201Cnon-hacky\u201D way in 1/20th of the time needed by `sssom-py`. In fact\
    \ I could have opted to manually download `sssom-cli` in this PR to use it straight\
    \ away (that would still have been faster than using `sssom-py`, even factoring\
    \ in the downloading time... that's how slow `sssom-py` is), but I decided it\

    \n\r\nIt can\u2019t. The prefix map is _not_ part of the SSSOM data model (maybe\
    \ it should, but it is not). Once the SSSOM file has been read, the code downstream\
    \ of the SSSOM reader has no access to whatever the original prefix map was.\r\
    \n\r\nSo it\u2019s up to ROBOT to provide the prefix map to be effectively used\
    \ when writing the results (either through the `--add-prefix` option, or through\
    \ a `prefix` declaration in the SSSOM/T ruleset)."
  - "Hmmm. This does not seem ideal. The fact that the `curie_map` is not mentioned\

  - "> So internally, how does sssom-java keep track of a subject_id? just a URI?\r\
    \n\r\nYes. The prefix map provided in the SSSOM file is used internally by the\
    \ reader to expand all CURIEs on the fly. Once the reader is done, the client\
    \ only gets full-length IRIs. This is the only sane way to deal with CURIEs. Expand\
    \ them as soon as possible (just after reading) and condense them as late as possible\
    \ (just before writing).\r\n\r\nAnd in this particular situation here, where we\
    \ generate the `mappings.owl` component from the mappings, I see no reason why\
    \ the original prefix map should be used, even if the model gave us access to\

    \ between two prefix maps? Should the first entry take precedence? The last entry?\
    \ Why?\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t have to worry about that because all \u201Cinput\u201D\
    \ prefix maps are discarded after use. If a prefix map has to be used for writing,\
    \ it has to be an explicitly specified one, at the discretion of the user."
  - ">  sssom-py for example just assumes that it is part for the \"format\" without\
    \ being part of the \"model\"\r\n\r\nYes, that\u2019s exactly the case. The _format_\
    \ has a CURIE map, but the _mapping set object_ does not. The CURIE map is only\
    \ an internal detail of the format. Once the reader has done its job of reading\
    \ the file, it gives you a _mapping set object_, with all the fields defined in\

    \ is entirely left to the user, there is no associated prefix name declaration.\
    \ Which makes those cross-references much less useful than they could be, but\

  pr_body: "This PR adds [Biomappings](https://biopragmatics.github.io/biomappings/)\
    \ as an \u201Cexternal SSSOM provider\u201D, allowing to automatically import\
    \ Uberon-related mappings from Biomappings into Uberon as cross-references.\r\n\
    \r\nRoughly, we fetch the SSSOM mapping set exported from Biomappings, filter\
    \ it to only keep the mappings pertaining to Uberon (strictly speaking this is\
    \ not necessary, but we do it because of the sheer size of the Biomappings set:\
    \ we commit the fetched set to the repository as for all the external resources,\
    \ and we don\u2019t want to commit a ~10MB file which mostly contains things unrelated\
    \ to Uberon), and then use it along with all the other mapping sets to generate\
    \ the `components/mappings.owl` component, which contains a user-friendly representation\
    \ of all the mappings as cross-references.\r\n\r\ncloses #3078 "

  pr_comments:
  - Why are these and the other 61 xrefs removed?
  - this is a bit hacky compared to `sssom parse` - you prefer less depency on sssom-py
    at the moment due to zero versioning I presume?
  - I cant judge these changes so I assume you have them under control :)
  - They're on the sssom tsv file now.
  - "Yep, so in the end they end up in the `components/mappings.owl` component, so\
    \ they don\u2019t need to be in the `-edit` file anymore."
  - "No, `sssom-py` is already included in the ODK anyway, so that is not the problem.\r\
    \n\r\nThe problem is that `sssom-py` is just excruciatingly slow, sorry. Just\
    \ assembling a single YAML+TSV file (which is necessary because `sssom dosql`\
    \ cannot use a mapping set with non-embedded metadata) takes (on my machine) 20\
    \ seconds:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ time sssom parse -I tsv biomappings.sssom.tsv -m\

    \ system 107% cpu 20.334 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen filtering out everything that\
    \ is not relevant for Uberon takes 30 more seconds:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ time sssom\
    \ dosql -Q \"SELECT * FROM df1 WHERE (subject_id LIKE 'UBERON:%' OR object_id\

    \ system 108% cpu 27.409 total\r\n```\r\n\r\n`sed` does that in less than one\
    \ second.\r\n\r\nIn the future, when the next release of the ODK (which includes\
    \ SSSOM-Java\u2019s `sssom-cli`) is available, we will be able to do everything\
    \ in a single step which will be less \u201Chacky\u201D and will also take less\
    \ than one second:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntime sssom-cli --prefix=UBERON=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_\
    \ -R \"(subject==UBERON:* || object==UBERON:*) -> include()\" -i biomappings.sssom.tsv\

  - Yes but you are trading an opportunity for standardising a workflow using a hack;
    there is a cost in that too; for example, there is a risk that the two pieces
    "don't fit together" (curie map is outdated etc), and you would never know. Its
    also less maintainable because there are 100 ways of doing this, and everyone
    could be doing it slightly differently creating cognitive overhead. I am not saying
    your judgement is wrong, I am just saying it that I would not consider it right
    to say that "runtime" is the only factor, and there are no tradeoffs.
  - "1. You can't complain that people are using Unix-level hacks to manipulate SSSOM\
    \ files when you specifically designed the format to be amenable to this kind\
    \ of hacks (quoting the SSSOM spec: \u201CAdditionally, it is a simple unix-level\
    \ or language-level operation to filter these as a pre-processing in a robust\
    \ fashion.\u201D)\r\n\r\n2. It's a _temporary_ hack until the next ODK version\
    \ is available. As I said above, the next ODK will natively include my `sssom-cli`\
    \ tool, which will allow to perform the desired operations (catenating the metadata\
    \ and the mappings themselves, and filtering the non-Uberon mappings) in a completely\
    \ \u201Cnon-hacky\u201D way in 1/20th of the time needed by `sssom-py`. In fact\
    \ I could have opted to manually download `sssom-cli` in this PR to use it straight\
    \ away (that would still have been faster than using `sssom-py`, even factoring\
    \ in the downloading time... that's how slow `sssom-py` is), but I decided it\
    \ was not worth it."

    \ is, for example, more fine-grained than dcterms:contributor so unlikely to be\
    \ a suitable match. "
  - "This is the only non-curie xref, I would strongly suggest to add the prefix.\
    \ \r\n\r\nBut I am a bit surprised what ROBOT has to do with this, as hasDbXref\
    \ are not of type \"IRI\" but of type string; I assume your plugin has to compress?\
    \ In this case, shouldn't it use the prefixmap supplied by the sssom file (`biomappings.sssom.yml`)?"
  - "> shouldn't it use the prefixmap supplied by the sssom file (biomappings.sssom.yml)?\r\
    \n\r\nIt can\u2019t. The prefix map is _not_ part of the SSSOM data model (maybe\
    \ it should, but it is not). Once the SSSOM file has been read, the code downstream\
    \ of the SSSOM reader has no access to whatever the original prefix map was.\r\
    \n\r\nSo it\u2019s up to ROBOT to provide the prefix map to be effectively used\
    \ when writing the results (either through the `--add-prefix` option, or through\
    \ a `prefix` declaration in the SSSOM/T ruleset)."
  - "Hmmm. This does not seem ideal. The fact that the `curie_map` is not mentioned\
    \ in the sssom data model needs to be remedied then, as sssom-py for example just\
    \ assumes that it is part for the \"format\" without being part of the \"model\"\
    \ - I guess this prevents it from being \"passed downstream\" according to your\
    \ thinking.\r\n\r\nSo internally, how does sssom-java keep track of a `subject_id`?\
    \ just a URI?"
  - "> So internally, how does sssom-java keep track of a subject_id? just a URI?\r\
    \n\r\nYes. The prefix map provided in the SSSOM file is used internally by the\
    \ reader to expand all CURIEs on the fly. Once the reader is done, the client\
    \ only gets full-length IRIs. This is the only sane way to deal with CURIEs. Expand\
    \ them as soon as possible (just after reading) and condense them as late as possible\
    \ (just before writing).\r\n\r\nAnd in this particular situation here, where we\
    \ generate the `mappings.owl` component from the mappings, I see no reason why\
    \ the original prefix map should be used, even if the model gave us access to\
    \ it. Doing otherwise would only open a can of worms, for example: we are merging\
    \ several mapping sets here (the one from Biomappings is only one among others),\
    \ they all come with their own prefix maps \u2013 how would we solve any conflict\
    \ between two prefix maps? Should the first entry take precedence? The last entry?\
    \ Why?\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t have to worry about that because all \u201Cinput\u201D\
    \ prefix maps are discarded after use. If a prefix map has to be used for writing,\
    \ it has to be an explicitly specified one, at the discretion of the user."
  - ">  sssom-py for example just assumes that it is part for the \"format\" without\
    \ being part of the \"model\"\r\n\r\nYes, that\u2019s exactly the case. The _format_\
    \ has a CURIE map, but the _mapping set object_ does not. The CURIE map is only\
    \ an internal detail of the format. Once the reader has done its job of reading\
    \ the file, it gives you a _mapping set object_, with all the fields defined in\
    \ the spec \u2013 and nothing more, so the map is _not_ part of it."

    \ example, it was practical enough to rebuild the bridge pipeline in Uberon, which\
    \ is the primary reason why I wrote SSSOM-Java in the first place.\r\n\r\nIn my\
    \ understanding of the problem the bridge file generation is a bit unrelated to\
    \ the question of whether \"two URIs can refer to the same entity\". This PR here\
    \ is about redistributing xrefs, not the bridge pipeline, right? So the argument\
    \ is purely about standardising whatever we redistribute, and again, yes, this\
    \ happens downstream (or ideally upstream, but certainly offstream) of SSSOM.\r\
    \n\r\n> ..parsing the Biomappings set with sssom-py (last version, 0.4.2) still\
    \ yields mesh CURIEs that expands to https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=,\
    \ despite the OBO context supposedly associating MESH identifiers to the http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/\
    \ prefix.\r\n\r\nThis is a mistake in the prefixmap, I will fix it. (The prefix\
    \ map is unfortunately an eternal work in progress)."
  - "> Sorry I didn't mean to say this \"should be solved by SSSOM\" - it is, as you\
    \ say, out of scope! [\u2026] reconciliation should be a special purpose convenience\
    \ method\r\n\r\nSo in the scope of SSSOM and unless you\u2019re running in a special\
    \ mode in which you explicitly want to mangle identifiers, if two identical CURIEs\
    \ expand to different full-length identifiers (because of a different prefix map),\
    \ the identifiers are _not_ the same and should not be treated as if they were\
    \ the same. Good.\r\n\r\n>  I think it is justifiable to say that we reconcile\
    \ prefixes before republishing them for our users\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s debatable\
    \ (who are we to say which URL prefix is to be used? for example, the Allen institute\
    \ now uses `https://purl.brain-bican.org/ontology/xxxo/XXX_` as its prefix for\
    \ its brain ontologies, why would we say that \u201Cno no no, we know better than\
    \ the folks at the Allen, the correct prefix is `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/XXX_`\u201D\
    ?), but okay, if it\u2019s an explicit move and not something done silently by\
    \ the implementation without any user opt-in. I can implement  such a \u201Creconciliation\u201D\
    \ as an option to `sssom-cli`.\r\n\r\n\r\n> In my understanding of the problem\
    \ the bridge file generation is a bit unrelated to the question of whether \"\
    two URIs can refer to the same entity\".\r\n\r\nThat question is _very_ relevant\
    \ for the generation of the bridges. The bridges are OWL files, and in OWL (as\
    \ in RDF), only full-length identifiers matter, and they are compared as opaque\
    \ strings without any notion of \u201CURL prefix\u201C. Maybe outside of OWL/RDF\
    \ you can pretend that `https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D123456` in one\
    \ file and `http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/D123456` in another file are actually the\
    \ same thing (because magic), but `<owl:Class rdf:about=\"https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D123456\"\
    >` and `<owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/D123456\">` are _never_\
    \ going to be considered the same, unless you have an explicit equivalence axiom.\r\
    \n\r\nSo it is very important to be sure we are dealing with the correct URL prefix\
    \ when we generate the bridges, if you don\u2019t want to generate a bridge that\
    \ connect to a different island than the one intended. Right now, we can be sure\
    \ of that because we only generate the bridges from two kinds of mappings:\r\n\
    \r\n*) mappings that we (Uberon editors) maintain ourselves in Uberon: we maintain\
    \ them, so we can check that we are using the correct prefixes;\r\n*) mappings\
    \ from CL, FBbt, and ZFA: we don\u2019t have control over them (well, I control\
    \ the FBbt ones but let\u2019s assume I don\u2019t) but they are mappings between\
    \ OBO resources only (CL-to-Uberon, FBbt-to-Uberon, ZFA-to-Uberon), so it\u2019\
    s all `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo` and there is little risk of anything fishy\
    \ happening with the identifiers (apart from an always possible silly mistake).\r\
    \n\r\n> This PR here is about redistributing xrefs, not the bridge pipeline, right?\r\
    \n\r\nThis PR, yes. This discussion, no. For distributing xrefs, this entire discussion\
    \ is actually irrelevant, since the xrefs are pure CURIEs whose interpretation\
    \ is entirely left to the user, there is no associated prefix name declaration.\
    \ Which makes those cross-references much less useful than they could be, but\
    \ well, that\u2019s what they have always been \u2013 we are generating and distributing\
    \ them only for backwards compatibility for the sake of people using tools that\
    \ know nothing else than `oboInOwl:hasDbXref`.\r\n\r\nThe only real problem in\
    \ this PR was the fact that the `https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=` prefix\
    \ was not declared, which prevented the `sssom-inject` command from shortening\
    \ `https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D123456` into `MESH:D123456`. This is\
    \ now fixed and an option has been added to raise an error if an undeclared prefix\
    \ sneaks in again.\r\n\r\nEverything else is a more general discussion that could\
    \ (should?) have happened elsewhere."

  - Why are these and the other 61 xrefs removed?
  - this is a bit hacky compared to `sssom parse` - you prefer less depency on sssom-py
    at the moment due to zero versioning I presume?
  - I cant judge these changes so I assume you have them under control :)
  - They're on the sssom tsv file now.
  - "Yep, so in the end they end up in the `components/mappings.owl` component, so\
    \ they don\u2019t need to be in the `-edit` file anymore."
  - "No, `sssom-py` is already included in the ODK anyway, so that is not the problem.\r\
    \n\r\nThe problem is that `sssom-py` is just excruciatingly slow, sorry. Just\
    \ assembling a single YAML+TSV file (which is necessary because `sssom dosql`\

    \ system 107% cpu 20.334 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen filtering out everything that\
    \ is not relevant for Uberon takes 30 more seconds:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ time sssom\
    \ dosql -Q \"SELECT * FROM df1 WHERE (subject_id LIKE 'UBERON:%' OR object_id\

    \ second.\r\n\r\nIn the future, when the next release of the ODK (which includes\
    \ SSSOM-Java\u2019s `sssom-cli`) is available, we will be able to do everything\
    \ in a single step which will be less \u201Chacky\u201D and will also take less\
    \ than one second:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ntime sssom-cli --prefix=UBERON=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_\

  - Yes but you are trading an opportunity for standardising a workflow using a hack;
    there is a cost in that too; for example, there is a risk that the two pieces
    "don't fit together" (curie map is outdated etc), and you would never know. Its
    also less maintainable because there are 100 ways of doing this, and everyone
    could be doing it slightly differently creating cognitive overhead. I am not saying
    your judgement is wrong, I am just saying it that I would not consider it right
    to say that "runtime" is the only factor, and there are no tradeoffs.
  - "1. You can't complain that people are using Unix-level hacks to manipulate SSSOM\
    \ files when you specifically designed the format to be amenable to this kind\

    \ or language-level operation to filter these as a pre-processing in a robust\
    \ fashion.\u201D)\r\n\r\n2. It's a _temporary_ hack until the next ODK version\
    \ is available. As I said above, the next ODK will natively include my `sssom-cli`\
    \ tool, which will allow to perform the desired operations (catenating the metadata\
    \ and the mappings themselves, and filtering the non-Uberon mappings) in a completely\
    \ \u201Cnon-hacky\u201D way in 1/20th of the time needed by `sssom-py`. In fact\
    \ I could have opted to manually download `sssom-cli` in this PR to use it straight\
    \ away (that would still have been faster than using `sssom-py`, even factoring\
    \ in the downloading time... that's how slow `sssom-py` is), but I decided it\
    \ was not worth it."

  - "This is the only non-curie xref, I would strongly suggest to add the prefix.\
    \ \r\n\r\nBut I am a bit surprised what ROBOT has to do with this, as hasDbXref\

  - "> shouldn't it use the prefixmap supplied by the sssom file (biomappings.sssom.yml)?\r\
    \n\r\nIt can\u2019t. The prefix map is _not_ part of the SSSOM data model (maybe\
    \ it should, but it is not). Once the SSSOM file has been read, the code downstream\
    \ of the SSSOM reader has no access to whatever the original prefix map was.\r\
    \n\r\nSo it\u2019s up to ROBOT to provide the prefix map to be effectively used\
    \ when writing the results (either through the `--add-prefix` option, or through\
    \ a `prefix` declaration in the SSSOM/T ruleset)."
  - "Hmmm. This does not seem ideal. The fact that the `curie_map` is not mentioned\
    \ in the sssom data model needs to be remedied then, as sssom-py for example just\
    \ assumes that it is part for the \"format\" without being part of the \"model\"\

  - "> So internally, how does sssom-java keep track of a subject_id? just a URI?\r\
    \n\r\nYes. The prefix map provided in the SSSOM file is used internally by the\
    \ reader to expand all CURIEs on the fly. Once the reader is done, the client\
    \ only gets full-length IRIs. This is the only sane way to deal with CURIEs. Expand\
    \ them as soon as possible (just after reading) and condense them as late as possible\
    \ (just before writing).\r\n\r\nAnd in this particular situation here, where we\
    \ generate the `mappings.owl` component from the mappings, I see no reason why\
    \ the original prefix map should be used, even if the model gave us access to\
    \ it. Doing otherwise would only open a can of worms, for example: we are merging\
    \ several mapping sets here (the one from Biomappings is only one among others),\
    \ they all come with their own prefix maps \u2013 how would we solve any conflict\
    \ between two prefix maps? Should the first entry take precedence? The last entry?\
    \ Why?\r\n\r\nWe don\u2019t have to worry about that because all \u201Cinput\u201D\
    \ prefix maps are discarded after use. If a prefix map has to be used for writing,\
    \ it has to be an explicitly specified one, at the discretion of the user."
  - ">  sssom-py for example just assumes that it is part for the \"format\" without\
    \ being part of the \"model\"\r\n\r\nYes, that\u2019s exactly the case. The _format_\
    \ has a CURIE map, but the _mapping set object_ does not. The CURIE map is only\
    \ an internal detail of the format. Once the reader has done its job of reading\
    \ the file, it gives you a _mapping set object_, with all the fields defined in\
    \ the spec \u2013 and nothing more, so the map is _not_ part of it."

    \ the bridge file generation is a bit unrelated to the question of whether \"\
    two URIs can refer to the same entity\".\r\n\r\nThat question is _very_ relevant\
    \ for the generation of the bridges. The bridges are OWL files, and in OWL (as\
    \ in RDF), only full-length identifiers matter, and they are compared as opaque\
    \ strings without any notion of \u201CURL prefix\u201C. Maybe outside of OWL/RDF\
    \ you can pretend that `https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D123456` in one\
    \ file and `http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/D123456` in another file are actually the\

    >` and `<owl:Class rdf:about=\"http://id.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/D123456\">` are _never_\
    \ going to be considered the same, unless you have an explicit equivalence axiom.\r\
    \n\r\nSo it is very important to be sure we are dealing with the correct URL prefix\
    \ when we generate the bridges, if you don\u2019t want to generate a bridge that\
    \ connect to a different island than the one intended. Right now, we can be sure\
    \ of that because we only generate the bridges from two kinds of mappings:\r\n\
    \r\n*) mappings that we (Uberon editors) maintain ourselves in Uberon: we maintain\
    \ them, so we can check that we are using the correct prefixes;\r\n*) mappings\
    \ from CL, FBbt, and ZFA: we don\u2019t have control over them (well, I control\
    \ the FBbt ones but let\u2019s assume I don\u2019t) but they are mappings between\
    \ OBO resources only (CL-to-Uberon, FBbt-to-Uberon, ZFA-to-Uberon), so it\u2019\
    s all `http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo` and there is little risk of anything fishy\
    \ happening with the identifiers (apart from an always possible silly mistake).\r\
    \n\r\n> This PR here is about redistributing xrefs, not the bridge pipeline, right?\r\
    \n\r\nThis PR, yes. This discussion, no. For distributing xrefs, this entire discussion\
    \ is actually irrelevant, since the xrefs are pure CURIEs whose interpretation\
    \ is entirely left to the user, there is no associated prefix name declaration.\
    \ Which makes those cross-references much less useful than they could be, but\
    \ well, that\u2019s what they have always been \u2013 we are generating and distributing\
    \ them only for backwards compatibility for the sake of people using tools that\
    \ know nothing else than `oboInOwl:hasDbXref`.\r\n\r\nThe only real problem in\
    \ this PR was the fact that the `https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=` prefix\
    \ was not declared, which prevented the `sssom-inject` command from shortening\
    \ `https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/record/ui?ui=D123456` into `MESH:D123456`. This is\
    \ now fixed and an option has been added to raise an error if an undeclared prefix\
    \ sneaks in again.\r\n\r\nEverything else is a more general discussion that could\
    \ (should?) have happened elsewhere."

    - "Thanks for copying me (and apologies for the delay!). The terms \u2018neck\u2019\
      \ or \u2018craniocervical\u2019 or \u2018cervical\u2019 aren\u2019t used in\
      \ the fish comparative literature for the region behind the skull, and as far\
      \ as I know, there is no generalized term for that region in fish anatomy. For\
      \ example, the vertebrae directly behind the head in fishes are called \u2018\
      precaudal vertebrae\u2019 meaning that they are anterior to the caudal vertebrae.\
      \ \r\n\r\n@megbalk and I reviewed the related ticket and if the best option\
      \ is a taxonomic constraint, we suggest using this: 'jugular vein' and ('in\
      \ taxon' some Sarcopterygii) SubClassOf 'part of' some neck. In the related\
      \ ticket, this was expressed at the level of Mammalia, but it can be broadened\
      \ to Sarcopterygii (lobe finned fishes)\u2013 see the curator note on \u2018\
      neck\u2019:\r\n\r\n\"true necks are considered to be present when the pectoral\
      \ girdle is separate from the skull - Tiktaalik is the earliest known fish to\
      \ have a true neck.\"\r\n"
    - unfortunately tooling support for taxon GCIs are not great. This means people
      coming to OLS etc with mammals in mind looking under neck would not see jugular
      vein.

  - issue_body: "A few structures of insects represented in Uberon have currently\
      \ two types of precursors:\r\n\r\n* an \u2018[anlage](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0006688)\u2019\
      ;\r\n* a \u2018[primordium](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001048)\u2019\
      .\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two being that an anlage is not yet morphologically\
      \ distinguishable from the surrounding tissues, contrary to a primordium.\r\n\
      \r\nSo we have, for example:\r\n\r\n* \u2018[insect Bolwig organ](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_6005805)\u2019\
      \r\n  * \u2018[develops from](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002202)\u2019\

      \r\n\r\nIt is not obvious that this level of precision is really useful in the\
      \ context of Uberon.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we also have \u2018[insect anlage in\
      \ statu nascendi](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_6005413)\u2019, which\
      \ refers to an even earlier stage than the anlage, and whose usefulness is even\
      \ more dubious.\r\n\r\nSo the proposal here is to:\r\n\r\n* **obsolete** \u2018\
      [insect anlage in statu nascendi](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_6005413)\u2019\
      ;\r\n* where we we have both a term for an anlage and a term for the primordium\
      \ which develops from it, **obsolete** the term for the anlage and suggest the\
      \ term for the primordium as replacement; the terms concerned would be:\r\n\
      \  * \u2018[insect abdominal histoblast anlage](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_6017021)\u2019\
      \r\n  * \u2018[insect adult clypeo-labral anlage](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_6004203)\u2019\

      .\r\n\r\nSlightly related to this issue, we also have two instances of situations\

      \ the larger anlage.\r\n\r\nThe proposal here is to:\r\n\r\n* **obsolete** \u2018\
      [insect dorsal ectoderm anlage](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_6005428)\u2019\

      \ \u2018[develops from](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002202)\u2019 the\

  - "In #3043, the 'neuroendocrine system' is classified as an 'anatomical system',\
    \ which has a text def asserting it to be a \"connected anatomical structure\"\
    .\r\n\r\nThe definition of the PATO class [disconnected](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PATO_0010001)\
    \ is \"A structural quality inhering in the bearer by virtue of the bearer consisting\
    \ of multiple structures lacking any physical connection to each other.\"\r\n\r\
    \nI'm not sure if the above means at a single instant in time. If not, one may\
    \ argue that physically distant structures of the (neuro)endocrine system are\
    \ connected over time via the release and binding of hormones, neurotransmitters,\
    \ etc.\r\n\r\nEither way, 'endocrine system' and neuroendocrine system' should\
    \ be modelled similarly."
  - "I agree that however \u201Cendocrine system\u201D is classified, \u201Cneuroendocrine\
    \ system\u201D should be classified similarly.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I think interpreting\
    \ \u201Cconnected\u201D as \u201Cconnected over space OR time\u201D is a bit of\
    \ a stretch, especially since there is nothing in the definition of all the related\
    \ terms that could suggest such a meaning. For example, [anatomical structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000061)\
    \ (which in Uberon is the root class for all things connected \u2013 including\

    \ inherent 3D shape\u201D \u2013 I don\u2019t see how this leaves room for involving\
    \ time.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the connected vs disconnected issue has been a regular\
    \ source of unsatisfiability (especially when merging Uberon with other ontologies,\
    \ because some other ontologies not only have a distinction between connected\
    \ and disconnected but also _enforce_ that distinction through disjointness axioms,\
    \ something that Uberon does not), so any change to the meaning of \u201C(dis)connected\u201D\
    \ should be discussed carefully in a dedicated ticket.\r\n\r\nThis PR merely restores\

    \ in Prot\xE9g\xE9. Can you enter your dbxref ORCID the same way you did for the\

  - The annotation property should still be database_cross_reference (not editor)
    and the ORCID would be entered in the IRI Editor screen.
  - '@bvarner-ebi Ok, sorry. I have never done like this. Should I correct all the
    previous ones? (I mean all the other terms I did in the past)'
  - '@paulacalipho, I don''t think it is necessary to fix the previous ones. @anitacaron,
    can you confirm and comment if there are any issues with recording ORCID in literal
    vs IRI Editor fields for the database_cross_reference?'
  - "@paulacalipho, I checked and it looks like the values in database_cross_reference\
    \ move from IRI to the literal after saving and reopening, so it does not seem\
    \ to make a difference. It may be because of the OBO format.\r\n\r\nRegardless,\

  - Consider using the term "neurohormone" as the current definition does not capture
    all neurohormones (e.g., steroid hormones).
  - "Consider the following definition, although I haven't found no-cost access to\
    \ the online reference:\r\n\r\nNeuroendocrine systems can be defined as the sets\
    \ of neurons, glands and non-endocrine tissues, and the neurochemicals, hormones,\
    \ and humoral signals they produce and receive, that function in an integrated\
    \ manner to collectively regulate a physiological or behavioral state.\r\nFrom:\
    \ [Handbook of Neuroendocrinology, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123750976100010)"
  - "Thank you for your comments and providing this reference.\r\nThe new updated\
    \ definition is the following:\r\n\r\n> A regulatory system of the body that integrates\
    \ the nervous system and the endocrine system. This system involves specialized\
    \ neuroendocrine cells primarily located in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland,\
    \ and various organs. The neuroendocrine system functions through the release\
    \ of neurotransmitters and hormones, enabling communication between these systems\
    \ to govern vitally important processes that include growth, reproduction, metabolism\
    \ and energy homeostasis, electrolyte and water balance, and responses to stress.\r\

    [Wikipedia:endocrinology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroendocrinology)"
  - 'The second sentence: "involves" and "various organs" are vague.'
  - "Beware that this definition (specifically the part \u201Cinvolves [\u2026] cells\
    \ **primarily located in the hypothalamus, pituitary gland**, and various organs\u201D\
    ) makes the term vertebrate-specific. Invertebrates may lack a hypothalamus or\
    \ a pituitary gland but they do have a \u201Cneuroendocrine system\u201D (see\
    \ for example [Hartenstein 2006](https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.1.06964)), so if\
    \ it is intended that this term should be vertebrate-specific then this should\
    \ be clearly stated; otherwise the definition should avoid referring to vertebrate-specific\
    \ structures or at least use precautions around them."
  - Thank you @gouttegd, the intention is that is not vertebrate-specific, and anything
    that is vertebrate-specific will be in a comment.
  - With the updated logical definition, would this be redundant?
  - "I don't think so. If K overlaps T, that means there is C that is the overlapping\
    \ part. If B is part of K, it does not mean that it is part of C (overlapping\
    \ T).\r\nFor clarification I have added a diagram and changed the letters:\r\n\

    \n"
  - "Is there a plan to revise 'neuroendocrine cell'? \r\nIf not, this may still be\
    \ redundant if keeping `'has part' some 'neuroendocrine cell'`.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"\

  - yes, neuroendocrine cell will not be a neuron after the revision.

  - '@aleixpuigb does this term require only is_a ''upper back skin'' without any

  - I would say that the skin of the scapula region is part_of some upper back skin.
  - '@aleixpuigb OK. Should I also add here a logical definition ''zone of skin''
    and (''part of'' some ''upper back skin'')?'
  - Not in this case. A logical definition needs to be true in all cases. However,
    there are zones of skin in the upper back skin that might not be skin of scapula
    region.
  - OK
  - "> @aleixpuigb does this term require only is_a 'upper back skin' without any\

      'endocrine hormone secretion' and 'regulation of endocrine secretion' are also

    - "Hi @raymond91125,\r\nIn the Uberon ontology call (21/08/23) it was decided\

  - "The original definition seems more specific-- it uses the words \"part of the\
    \ airway\" instead of the vague \"lung unit\". The paper acknowledges that this\
    \ (the added text) is a functional definition and the aim of the study seems an\

  - I am reaching out to a lung expert on this. From my current understanding of the
    pulmonary acinus, I like the new definition. This structure/unit is not part of
    the airway, it contains a specific section of the airway. Additionally, the pulmonary
    acinus contains more than just the airway, there is supporting tissue, vasculature,
    etc. As such, I do believe the original definition is not only lacking but technically
    inaccurate. I will update when I know more.
  - Thank you Joshua, I will wait for the update before merging.

  - After a cursory review, I found that they are in the cerebellum. Consider adding
    'part of' some cerebellum https://doi.org/10.3389/fncir.2020.611841
  - the dbxref is using a rdfs comment as an annotation property instead of database_cross_reference
  - "I am not sure if I agree with this axiom. The definition of has_part is not very\
    \ clear either: a core relation that holds between a whole and its part.\r\nThe\
    \ way I understand is that the whole (but not all!) cerebellar granule cell are\
    \ part of the fiber. However, in this case, only the axioms are part of the fiber.\
    \ Overlaps is more general, but that's the object property I would consider using\
    \ in this case.\r\nHowever, as @dosumis [requested this axiom](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/2012#issue-1747510248),\
    \ I will defer the review of it to him."

  - "Checking a similar relationship:\r\n '[dentate gyrus mossy fiber](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/GO_0044302)'\
    \ has\r\n`SubClass Of 'part of' some 'granule cell'`.\r\n\r\nGiven that, here\

  - While the majority of parallel fibers are unmyelinated, there are some myelinated
    parallel fibers [PMID:15869526](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15869526). As
    the myelin sheath is not part of the 'cerebellar granule cell', I would not use
    'part of'.

    - '@cmungall the question is, what exactly are they placeholders for? Where is
      the pipeline that fills them in with actual definitions?'
    - My understanding is that they are just placeholders waiting to be replaced by
      an actual definition _by a human editor_. They are not intended to be automatically
      transformed into something (contrary to what we do in FBbt), they are just here
      to remind the editors that a real definition will need to be put here sometimes
      in the future (with the xref giving a clue about where to find the information
      to create the definition).
    - Usually they are placeholders for some kind of pattern based replacement strategy.
      If it is to remind humans, I would vote to ditch them.

    - '@anitacaron to relook at this'
    - From the OWL artefacts, this issue is still present only in `uberon-base.owl`,`uberon-full.owl`
      and `basic.owl` files.
    - the . defs are not in uberon.owl which is good, however, we might need to look
      into implementing this on -base file if these are going to be used for imports
    - Can someone figure out where they come from, i.e. from withing uberon-edit.obo?
      I am assuming these are from some import?
    - just checked uberon-edit.obo - the . defs are there
    - In an import or the actual file?
    - ah sorry.. of course.. I am stupid. I meant, the . definitions that are still
      in uberon-base.owl, are they from uberon-edit or an import?
    - I assume edit file given that I checked UBERON:0004133 and both edit and base
      file has the . def
    - ok so it is an @anitacaron issue. Thanks for checking!
    - "I read Chris' comment carefully and first need to modify `uberon-edit` file\
      \ before deleting the 'dot definitions'.\r\n\r\n- [X] The phenoscape ones should\
      \ be replaced by ~~created-by~~ dcterms:contributor\r\n- [ ] GO and MP provide\

      \ seems not taking `uberon-edit.obo`, but `uberon-edit.owl` that is in the temporary\
      \ folder."
    - "> Also, I checked uberon.Makefile and it seems not taking uberon-edit.obo,\
      \ but uberon-edit.owl that is in the temporary folder.\r\n\r\ntmp/uberon-edit.owl\
      \ comes from uberon-edit.obo :)\r\n\r\nThanks @anitacaron for the breakdown!\r\
      \n"
    - The `delete-dot-definition` SPARQL query is only used in `tmp/uberon-edit.owl`;
      that's why they're still in the `uberon-edit.obo` file.
    - Yeah the question is, how do they end up in uberon-base, or basic.owl? These
      are all derived from tmp/uberon-edit.owl..
    - After look the graph generated from the makefiles, they all came from `uberon-edit.obo`
      defined on the main Makefile. They're not overridden on `uberon.makefile`.
    - "That is the problem. its also a bit of a general problem with makefiles.. Ideally,\
      \ we have\r\n\r\n- Nothing in the makefile dependent on uberon-edit.obo, except\
      \ tmp/uberon-edit.owl\r\n- Everything that previously dependent on uberon-edit.obo\
      \ (`$(SRC)`) now depending on tmp/uberon-edit.owl.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be\
      \ hard, but if it works for Uberon, we can generalise this for ODK."
    - Also see https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2053
    - "- [ ] Depends on https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/issues/544\r\
      \n\r\nAfter this is solved than uberon-base will depend on tmp/uberon-edit and\
      \ then the dot removal will work."
    - This issue has not seen any activity in the past 6 months; it will be closed
      automatically one year from now if no action is taken.
    - We'll have a new ODK release soon that will fix the issue only in the release
      artefact. The 'dot definitions' will still be present in the edit file.

  - "The text def of connected to:\r\n\"a is connected to b if and only if a and b\
    \ are discrete structure, and there exists some connecting structure c, such that\
    \ c connects a and b\"\r\n\r\nIn this relationship, what is 'c'? Can it be 'respiratory\
    \ bronchiole' if 'respiratory bronchiole' is already asserted to be part of the\
    \ 'pulmonary acinus'?"
  - 'Thank you for this comment, Bradley. There is this related ticket in Uberon #2926
    and it was treated in the last Uberon call (19/06/23) about the usage of connected
    to and how it is not aligned with the definitions. However, it was agreed to use
    this object property for the pulmonary system.'
  - yes, in this case 'respiratory bronchiole' would be c and the usage of connected_to
    would be more aligned with the definition.

      \ pulmonary lobule' UBERON:0010369\r\n\r\n**Suggested revision and reasons**\r\
      \nNo relationship between these terms exists currently in uberon. The current\
      \ definition of `secondary pulmonary lobule` is:\r\n> A unit of lung supplied\
      \ by three to five terminal bronchioles and contained by fibrous septa.\r\n\r\
      \nThis definition is supported by the dbxref [PMID:3259815](https://www.ajronline.org/doi/epdf/10.2214/ajr.151.1.21):\r\
      \n![image](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/assets/94959119/0acec19e-b24c-460c-aaf5-2ecdb393839b)\r\
      \n\r\nand this article https://doi.org/10.1148/93.3.507:\r\n> The secondary\
      \ pulmonary lobule can be defined in two ways: [...] and (b) a unit of lung\
      \ structure supplied by a cluster of three to five terminal bronchioles.\r\n\
      \r\nHowever, in the dbxref [PMID:3259815](https://www.ajronline.org/doi/epdf/10.2214/ajr.151.1.21),\
      \ it also can be found:\r\n![image](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/assets/94959119/1f1f9cd4-b9cc-421a-9554-8acd97044565)\r\

      \n\r\nThe RO term in supplies is only applied in arteries:\r\n> Relation between\
      \ an arterial structure and another structure, where the arterial structure\
      \ acts as a conduit channeling fluid, substance or energy.\r\n\r\nAnd the parent\
      \ property `connected to` doesn't seem adequate as from the last definition\
      \ the `terminal bronchiole` is inside the `secondary pulmonary lobule` (partly\
      \ or completely).\r\n\r\nTherefore, the object properties that would be most\
      \ appropriate would be `part of` if all and the whole terminal bronchioles are\
      \ inside the secondary pulmonary lobules, or `overlaps` if all terminal bronchioles\
      \ are partly inside the secondary pulmonary lobules.\r\n\r\nIn this [article](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Thin-section-CT-of-the-secondary-pulmonary-lobule%3A-Webb/659e8cbf37f651ca37166afedc1acdde89e07b19)\
      \ (behind a paywall but figures and tables are available), the diagram shows\
      \ that the terminal bronchiole is inside the lobule and is the lobular bronchiole\
      \ that enters in the secondary pulmonary lobule:\r\n![image](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/assets/94959119/bcf81db2-f9eb-418a-ab97-8a4818b4e0af)\r\
      \n\r\nTherefore, it seems appropriate to add the axiom `terminal bronchiole\
      \ SubclasOf 'part of' some 'secondary pulmonary lobule'`\r\n\r\n```[tasklist]\r\
      \n### Tasks\r\n- [ ] Add terminal bronchiole SubclasOf 'part of' some 'secondary\
      \ pulmonary lobule\r\n- [ ] Update 'terminal bronchiole' text definition to\
      \ reflect the new relationship\r\n```\r\n"

  pr_comments:
  - Given the ambiguity you detail in the linked issue, keeping the original definition
    (which doesn't seem contested) and using the relationship "overlaps" may be a
    less controversial solution. Will defer to @JoshuaFortriede or another SME for
    confirmation.
  - See above. Consider overlaps.

    \ (paywall article) states:\r\n\r\n`Each secondary lobule is supplied by a small\
    \ bronchiole`\r\n\r\nand [Ohno 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8165947/)\
    \ states:\r\n\r\n`The secondary pulmonary lobule is supplied by a lobular bronchiole\
    \ `\r\n\r\nThese definitions match my understanding; that the primary bronchiole\
    \ is the street into the neighborhood (secondary pulmonary lobule), and the terminal\
    \ bronchioles are the main streets contained within that neighborhood. As such,\

  - "Thank you for your input and clarification, @JoshuaFortriede. The cheat sheet\
    \ is very useful!\r\n\r\n> I would also suggest adding that the terminal bronchiole\
    \ is between the primary bronchiole and respiratory bronchiole. Specifically the\

    In a different ticket #2957 I have already added `'terminal bronchiole' SubclassOf\
    \ ' distally connected to' some 'respiratory bronchiole'`. However, [mice have\
    \ none or few respiratory bronchioles](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13326-019-0209-1),\
    \ and therefore 'terminal bronchioles' are connected to alveolar ducts. Therefore\
    \ I will have to revert that axiom in a different ticket. On the other side, the\
    \ lobular bronchiole can be found between the primary bronchiole and the respiratory\
    \ bronchiole. I would like to investigate a bit more before adding that axiom.\r\

  - Given Joshua's comment, I think part_of is ok
  - "Consider using singular form in the def:\r\n\r\nA bronchiole that is part of\
    \ a secondary pulmonary lobule and the last conducting structure of **a** non-respiratory\

      \ flows through the duct. It has two cell layers: basal and luminal. It is continuous\
      \ with the secretory coil and goes towards the skin surface. The distal segment\
      \ of the duct is relatively straight and connects with the acrosyringium in\
      \ the epidermis. Most of the ion reabsorption occurs in the proximal part of\
      \ the duct. \r\n(PMID:31608304)\r\n**ORCID** https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0819-0473\r\

    \ an eccrine sweat gland.\"\r\n\r\n-  \"... duct of the eccrine sweet gland...\
    \ \" --> \"...  duct of the eccrine **sweat** gland... \"\r\n"
  - Consider if 'epithelial tube' is accurate and more appropriate.
  - Consider moving **cell type** details to the CL terms.
  - Consider adding axioms to capture these cell types, e.g., 'has part' some 'clear
    cell of eccrine sweat gland'.

  - Consider keeping the first two sentences in the text definition and relegating
    the rest to a comment.
  - If "dorsal rim of the iris" is an exact synonym, consider adding (dbxref [PMID:29579253](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29579253)).
  - Also consider if a new GO term 'Wolffian lens regeneration' is warranted.
  - Indeed this term does not exist in GO. Should I make a NTR to GO?

    \ is defined as an [organ](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000062). I\u2019\
    d suggest [subdivision of trunk](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0009569)\
    \ as a parent."
  - Given that definition, maybe consider adding an explicit taxon restriction to
    vertebrates?
  - '@gouttegd I made it child of "thoracic region of vertebral column". But now I
    think is better child of "posterior region of body". What do you think?'
  - '@gouttegd or ''subdivision of trunk''?'
  - "_Thoracic region of vertebral column_ doesn\u2019t sound right, for two reasons:\r\
    \n\r\n* it limits the region to the thorax, while the vertebral column extends\
    \ beyond it;\r\n* that would make the paraspinal region a part of the vertebral\
    \ column itself, while it is supposed to the region adjacent to it.\r\n\r\n_Subdivision\
    \ of trunk_ could be good, with the caveat that [trunk](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002100)\
    \ is defined as \u201Cthe part of the body _posterior to the cervical region_\u201D\
    \ \u2013 so again, using that as a parent would limit the extent of the paraspinal\
    \ region to the region of the body adjacent to the thoraco-abdominal segment of\
    \ the column, excluding the cervical segment. Now if that term is commonly used\
    \ with that meaning, it\u2019s good, but then the textual definition should be\
    \ amended to reflect that."
  - _posterior region of body_ looks good.
  - When I suggested adding an explicit taxon restriction to vertebrates, I meant
    adding it to the new _paraspinal region_ term. No reason to change the existing
    taxon restriction on [subvidision of skeletal system](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000075).
  - '@gouttegd yes, sorry, I will correct it now'
  - 'Again: please add the taxon restriction directly to the new term _paraspinal
    region_ that you are adding in this PR, not to any parental term.'

  - 'Regarding text def for both: sector --> segment'
  - Thank you, @bvarner-ebi. Looking at [this](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6247100/#:~:text=The%20three%20hepatic%20veins%20divide,1).)
    the liver has 8 segments and 4 sectors. We are referring only to the sector.
  - "@aleixpuigb, thank you for clarifying. \r\n\r\nThe labels and synonyms include\
    \ the word \"lobe\", but the text definitions of these classes are describing\
    \ sectors, not lobes. A similar comment related to brain regions: https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2832#issuecomment-1520538497\r\
    \n\r\nIf the classes are meant to represent the sectors, consider renaming the\
    \ labels and synonyms.\r\n\r\nAlso consider adding synonyms that substitute \"\
    liver\" with \"hepatic\" as included in the dbxrefs, e.g., \"right hepatic anterior\
    \ sector\" PMID:[30487943](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30487943)"
  - I agree that the class names are misleading. I propose changing to `posterior/anterior
    sector of right lobe of liver` to align with the parental class. This change will
    also be in the synonyms. I also propose doing the same with the rest of the hepatic
    terms (in a separate ticket).
  - Consider making this a related, not exact, synonym. Sector vs lobe.

    - "Before proposing any changes to the classes below _anatomical cluster_, I\u2019\
      d like to make sure that there is a consensus about what an \u201Canatomical\
      \ cluster\u201D actually is.\r\n\r\nThe term is currently defined as \u201C\
      an anatomical group that has its parts adjacent to each other\u201D. It is a\
      \ subclass of _disconnected anatomical group_, which is itself defined as \u201C\
      a material anatomical entity consisting of multiple anatomical structures that\
      \ are not connected to each other\u201D.\r\n\r\nOne question that the current\
      \ definition raises is the meaning of \u201Cadjacent\u201D. Should it mean that\
      \ the parts making up the clusters are _in physical contact_ with each other,\
      \ or merely that they are _close_ to each other?\r\n\r\nIf we take it to mean\
      \ that the parts are in physical contact, then that would mean that they are\
      \ _connected_, in which case the classification under _disconnected anatomical\
      \ group_ is wrong by definition.\r\n\r\nFor reference, FBbt\u2019s definition\
      \ for _anatomical cluster_ is \u201Can anatomical group whose component anatomical\
      \ structures lie in close proximity to each other\u201D. I may have a pro-FBbt\
      \ bias here, but I believe FBbt\u2019s definition is more correct \u2013 and\
      \ incidentally, it is consistent with the definition of \u201Ccluster\u201D\
      \ in most dictionaries ([Cambridge](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/cluster),\
      \ [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cluster), [Collins](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/cluster)).\r\
      \n\r\nI\u2019d like to propose that Uberon follows FBbt on that point. Then\
      \ we could decide if a given entity made of several parts is an anatomical cluster\
      \ or something else as follows:\r\n\r\n* Are the parts all connected? Then it\u2019\
      s some kind of _anatomical structure_.\r\n* Otherwise it\u2019s some kind of\
      \ _disconnected anatomical group_.\r\n  * Are the parts in close proximity?\
      \ Then it\u2019s a _anatomical cluster_. (I am aware that \u201Cclose proximity\u201D\
      \ leaves room for interpretation; I am open to suggestions for a stricter criterion\
      \ to apply here)\r\n  * On the contrary, are the parts spread throughout the\
      \ organism, yet still function together to fulfil a common function? Then it\
      \ may be a _non-connected functional system_ (e.g. _endocrine system_).\r\n"
    - "I think these kinds of very abstract grouping classes should be modeled as\
      \ properties or characteristics of some kind. See:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/BFO-ontology/BFO/issues/221\r\
      \n\r\nbut happy to align with fbbt as an intermediate step"
    - "In Uberon _disconnected anatomical group_ is a subclass of `'has quality' some\
      \ disconnected` (PATO:0010001), and _anatomical structure_ is a subclass of\
      \ `'has quality' some 'maximally connected'` (PATO:0010000).\r\n\r\nSo you would\
      \ suggest to find (or create if they don\u2019t already exist in PATO or elsewhere)\
      \ more qualities to more finely distinguish the different types of entities?\
      \ E.g., something like `'has quality' some 'closely grouped'` or similar for\
      \ _anatomical cluster_, if we follow FBbt\u2019s meaning of the term?"
    - "The PATO term seems a bit vague here. I think if we feel that clustered in\
      \ the FBbt concept is a useful concept for AOs then it's worth making a PATO\
      \ subclass?\r\n\r\nIt looks like many of the existing 'clusters' are essentially\
      \ mereological sums / \"set\" terms. I think it's worth having a DP for these\
      \ but I don't think that is the intent of the CARO class"
    - "Just to be clear, _closely grouped_ does **not** exist in PATO, I just made\
      \ it up for the example because it doesn\u2019t look like there already is a\
      \ quality in PATO that we could use to qualify \u201Cclusters\u201D.\r\n\r\n\
      I\u2019d be happy with a _clustered_ quality instead, with an agreed upon definition."
    - "Here\u2019s the rest of the problems with the _anatomical cluster_ hierarchy.\r\
      \n\r\nBarring any objection, I\u2019ll submit a PR to fix the issues highlighted\
      \ in the first two sections below (cross-references and subclasses that belong\
      \ elsewhere). The other issues will require more time and more input.\r\n\r\n\
      ## Obsolete cross-references\r\n\r\nUberon\u2019s _anatomical cluster_ has a\
      \ cross-reference to CARO\u2019s [anatomical cluster](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CARO_0000041),\
      \ which is obsolete and replaced with [multi organ part structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CARO_0020001),\
      \ which has a different meaning than the one intended in Uberon for \u201Canatomical\
      \ cluster\u201D (and which is already linked to Uberon\u2019s own [multi organ\
      \ part structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0034921).\r\n\r\nUnless\
      \ we happen to have a policy of keeping cross-references to obsolete foreign\
      \ terms (e.g. for backwards compatibility?), the CARO cross-reference should\
      \ be removed. And along with it, I would also suggest to remove all cross-references\
      \ to what I would call \u201CCARO term copies\u201D \u2013 terms in other ontologies\
      \ that mimic the obsolete CARO term, sometimes to the point that they use the\
      \ same CURIE number (e.g. [BILA:0000041](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BILA_0000041),\
      \ [HAO:0000041](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/HAO_0000041), [FZA:0001478](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ZFA_0001478)...).\r\
      \n\r\nCross-reference to [FMA:49443](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FMA_49443)\
      \ should be removed as well, since the FMA term has a very different definition\
      \ (which is closer to _multi organ part structure_ than to _anatomical cluster_).\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n## Subclasses that belong elsewhere\r\n\r\nA handful of classes can\
      \ confidently be re-classified somewhere else than under _anatomical cluster_:\r\
      \n\r\n* [accessory articulation](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_3000809)\
      \ -> move under [multi organ part structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0034921);\r\
      \n* [glottis](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002486) -> move under [anatomical\
      \ structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000061);\r\n* [hard palate](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003216)\
      \ -> move under [multi organ part structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0034921);\r\
      \n* [soft palate](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001733) -> move under\
      \ [multi organ part structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0034921);\r\
      \n* [head capsule](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003153) -> move under\
      \ [insect region of integument]() (mimic the FBbt classification; the term should\
      \ also be rename to make it clearer it is intended for insects);\r\n* [insect\
      \ analia](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_6004823) -> move under [anatomical\
      \ structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000061) (mimic the FBbt\
      \ classification);\r\n* [juxtaglomerular apparatus](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002303)\
      \ -> move under [anatomical structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000061),\
      \ as per the definition;\r\n* [muscle spindle](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003718)\
      \ -> move under [anatomical structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000061);\r\
      \n* [lower urinary tract](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001556) ->\
      \ move under [organ system subdivision](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011216);\r\
      \n* [upper urinary tract](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011143) ->\
      \ move under [organ system subdivision](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011216);\r\
      \n* [ocular adnexa](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0035639) -> move under\
      \ [multi organ part structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0034921);\r\
      \n* [osseus cochlea](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0007223) -> move\
      \ under [anatomical structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000061);\r\
      \n* [palatoglossal arch](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011640) -> move\
      \ under [multi organ part structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0034921);\r\
      \n* [pharyngeal arch system](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0008814)\
      \ -> move under [multi organ part structure](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0034921).\r\
      \n\r\n\r\n## Under-defined, possibly taxon-specific classes\r\n\r\nA handful\
      \ of classes seem to come straight from taxon-specific ontologies, have little\
      \ or no definition (making it difficult to assess whether they belong under\
      \ _anatomical cluster_ of not), and may have (if they are really taxon-specific)\
      \ a name that is too generic:\r\n\r\n* [intervening zone](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2001341);\r\
      \n* [medial column](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2000542);\r\n* [midline\
      \ column](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2000241);\r\n* [opercular series](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2001875)\
      \ \u2014 the name \u201Cseries\u201D does suggest it is a cluster of some sort\
      \ (like other similarly named classes such as [infraorbital series](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2001709)\
      \ or [epibranchial series](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2002102)),\
      \ but without any definition it's hard to be sure;\r\n* [pars inferior ear](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2005410);\r\
      \n* [pars superior ear](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2005409);\r\n\
      * [postzonal element](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_3000938);\r\n* [prezonal\
      \ element](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_3000938);\r\n* [zonal area](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_3000757);\r\
      \n* [ventricular musculature](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_3010243);\r\
      \n* [visceromotor column](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2000611);\r\n\
      \r\n\r\n## Other various problematic classes\r\n\r\n* [entire embryonic mesenchym](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0009142)\
      \ \u2014 definitely not a \u201Ccluster\u201D under any reasonable definition,\
      \ but unsure where it should go;\r\n* [exoskeleton](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0006611)\
      \ \u2014 likewise;\r\n* [hypophysial region](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_4200248);\r\
      \n* [proliferative region](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2000098), coming\
      \ from TAO, where it has as \u201Cexact synynoms\u201D terms such as _cell cycle_,\
      \ _proliferation_, _cell division_ (to which my reaction is \u201Cerr, what\
      \ the hell\u2026?\u201D); ZFA defines it as \u201Ccluster of rapidly dividing\
      \ cells\u201D, which sounds like something that could be made more generic and\
      \ used elsewhere;\r\n* [region of neural crest](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0010170)\
      \ \u2014 the cross-referenced terms in ZFA, EMAPA, and TAO all represent the\
      \ actual _neural crest_ and not a region of it, and the definition also sounds\
      \ like the term is referring to the entire neural crest, so it\u2019s unclear\
      \ what the term is really about;\r\n* [renal pelvis / ureter](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0036295)\
      \ \u2014 a term intended to group the [renal pelvis](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001224)\
      \ and the [ureter](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0000056) \u2014 is\
      \ such a grouping term really necessary? if so, it probably belongs under [organ\
      \ system subdivision](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0011216);\r\n* [shell](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0006612)\
      \ \u2014 again, not a \u201Ccluster\u201D, but unsure where it should belong;\r\
      \n* [subungual region](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0004105) \u2014\
      \ not a \u201Ccluster\u201D and possibly redundant with [nail bed](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0005273);\r\
      \n* [vasculature](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0002049) \u2014 not\
      \ a \u201Ccluster\u201D and possibly redundant with [vascular system](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0007798);\r\
      \n* [dorsal fin pterygiophore](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2001419)\
      \ \u2014 the definition makes it a \u201Ccluster\u201D all right, but it seems\
      \ that the name actually refer to the individual elements that make up the cluster\
      \ (which seems confirmed by all the _dorsal fin pterygiophore X_ subclasses);\r\
      \n* [anal fin pterygiophore](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2001420)\
      \ \u2014 likewise.\r\n"

  pr_comments:
  - Could not find this in EHDAA2 using OLS. Should it be removed as well?
  - Unsure if this refers to something that is "multi organ".
  - "I can\u2019t find it through Ontobee or BioPortal as well, so I agree, I\u2019\
    ll remove it."
  - "Each vertebra is individually considered as a separate \u201Corgan\u201D (a _vertebra_\
    \ is a _vertebral element_, which is a _skeletal element_, which is an _organ_),\
    \ so I think it is consistent to say that an articulation between two vertebrae\
    \ is a \u201Cmulti organ part structure\u201C \u2013 it involves subparts of two\
    \ different organs, which fits the definition of \u201Cmulti organ part structure\u201C\
    .\r\n\r\nBut this makes me realise that this term can be classified even more\
    \ precisely under _articulation_ (UBERON:0004905), which is a subclass of _multi\
    \ organ part structure_. I\u2019ll do that now."

  - "Consider replacing \"the\" with \"a\", i.e., \r\nBranch of conducting airway\
    \ between a segmental bronchus and a preterminal bronchiole.\r\n\r\nI believe\
    \ the second sentence is applicable to all bronchi (and the trachea), even though\
    \ I did not see this mentioned in the wikipedia reference and don't have ready\
    \ access to the ISBNs. The features noted in the second sentence may suggest they\
    \ are distinguishing features compared to segmental bronchi mentioned in the first\
    \ sentence. \r\n\r\nIf you'd like to keep it, consider writing, \"Like other bronchi,\
    \ the wall of a subsegmental bronchus contains...\"\r\n"
  - "The doi link is behind a paywall, but the following picture is in the chapter\
    \ referenced. Interestingly, here they refer the subsegmental bronchus as intrasegmental\
    \ bronchus, and therefore it will be added as a related synonym.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn\
    \ the PMID reference, the text is more general to all bronchi, but it reflects\
    \ that the most distally the bronchi are, the smaller and widely dispersed the\
    \ cartilage plates get.\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94959119/230328392-d90c395d-a799-4c03-a658-274a1ae80ae9.png)\r\

  - If "preterminal bronchiole" is the same as a 'lobular bronchiole' as noted with
    the exact synonym, consider revising to remove this tautology.
  - Thank you for your comment. I have replaced 'preterminal bronchiole' with 'conductive
    airway'.
  - Since there is still a dbxref from FMA, consider keeping this note or updating
    it to reflect that historically Uberon considered bronchiole and 'lobular bronchiole'
    as exact synonyms.
  - It is strange that FMA has a separate class for "lobular bronchiole" and at the
    same time is a synonym of "bronchiole". The comment has been added again (line
    44033).
  - Consider removing this synonym as well.
  - Thank you for spotting this synonym. I have also removed a "mucosa of bronchiole"
    synonym.
  - To note, PMID:16543587 is behind a paywall. PMID:27611890 mentions "preterminal
    bronchiole", but not "lobular bronchiole".
  - Unsure why this was added.
  - Unsure what "A portion of" is meant to convey... is there another portion of smooth
    muscle tissue in the lobular bronchiole that is not included in this class?

    - "Dear Anne,\r\n\r\nI agree to __remove \"prefemoral lymph node\" as synonym__,\
      \ authors also say is somewhat unfortunate synonym\r\n\r\nAmong the child classes\
      \ of UBERON:0015877 parietal pelvic lymph node, the differences with FMA are:\r\
      \n\r\n1- subiliac lymph node does not appear in UBERON\r\n2- the equivalent\
      \ of FMA:16655 \"Sacral lymph node\" (UBERON_0002528 \"sacral lymph node\")\
      \ is child of another class:   sublumbar lymph node UBERON:8470001 \r\n\r\n\
      The fact that \"sacral lymph node\" UBERON_0002528 appears in another subclass\
      \ seems curated by someone and not automatically transfer. But I am not able\
      \ to find the curator. May be was on purpose also that subiliac lymph node is\
      \ not there.\r\n\r\nThe term __Subiliac Lymph Node (Code C92594) also exists\
      \ in NCI thesaurus__ https://thesaurus.cancer.gov/ncitbrowser/pages/concept_details.jsf\r\
      \n\r\nAnother conflict I see is that the definition in the literature of subiliac\
      \ lymph node in swine and mouse indicates lymph node of __abdomen__, and here\
      \ are of __pelvis__. According to the picture seems to me is the lower part\
      \ of the abdomen\r\n\r\n I am afraid, I was not able to advance. Should we contact\

  - "@megbalk, labelling as 'cranial temporal crest' with exact synonym \"temporal\

    \ line.\r\n"
  - "The cranial temporal crest is bounded by the superior and inferior temporal lines,\
    \ but is not the same as the temporal line. It is also not the same as the structure\

    \ on the position of the cranial temporal crest. @helenamachado\r\n\r\nI hesitate\
    \ to make an exact synonym with \"temporal crest\" since there seems to be two\

  - "Hi, @megbalk,\r\n\r\n> The cranial temporal crest is bounded by the superior\
    \ and inferior temporal lines, but is not the same as the temporal line. \r\n\r\
    \nConsider adding a dbxref to support this assertion in the text def. If @helenamachado\

  - "> Does a broad synonym to \"temporal bone\" make more sense?\r\n\r\nAssuming\
    \ you mean \"temporal crest\", perhaps **related synonym** would be appropriate.\
    \ \r\nThis is because you are defining the term based on a paper that calls it\
    \ the \"temporal crest\", so that term means exactly what your are defining, but\
    \ that term may also refer to other \"temporal crests\", like as you noted above,\
    \ on the mandible. Considering the potential ambiguity (the term may refer to\
    \ exactly what you are defining or to a completely separate structure), related\
    \ may be the \"safest\" choice."

      \ system, consider describing how you are assigning the numbers (e.g., the tooth\
      \ in the second position that is counted by starting from the upper, most posterior\
      \ tooth).\r\n"
    - '@bvarner-ebi Do you know of tooth numbering systems that are cross species?

      \ not, but this is not my area of expertise. Modified Triadan appears to be\
      \ cross-species. \r\n\r\nIf there is no cross-species numbering system that\
      \ works for this case, I recommend clarifying (in the text def or a comment)\
      \ how these are arbitrarily being assigned numbers, e.g., the tooth in the second\

      \ tooth and proceeding in a clockwise direction."
    - "> Modified Triadan appears to be cross-species.\r\n\r\nInteresting ... I wasn't\
      \ aware of that system :)"
    - '@bvarner-ebi @wdduncan I don''t think either system is being used here. It''s
      based on an idea of homology for a tooth, where the first tooth isn''t arbitrary,
      it''s the same tooth type that emerges in that first position. This means that
      sometimes the "first" tooth of a tooth type is actually the second, like the
      second premolar.'
    - '@megbalk Perhaps you can use labels like `first homologous incisor tooth`?
      Does this makes it clear that the numbering is baed on homology and not tooth
      position?'
    - Would that be a synonym? I am hesitant to rename _all_ the teeth...
    - Only for those tooth classes in which the axis of classification is homology.
    - I think in Uberon that is all of them? Like molar tooth 1, molar tooth 2, etc.
      which already exist. It would require us to redo all those terms. I think I
      assumed "phylogenetically" meant something along the same lines of homologous?
    - "The issue I think is that the label \"molar tooth 1\" may be too ambiguous\
      \ (given the different tooth nomenclatures). My suggestion was meant to disambiguate\
      \ the label. \r\n\r\nFor example, because I've used the ADA tooth numbering\
      \ system for too long, when I see \"molar tooth 1\", I think of the upper-right\
      \ wisdom tooth. \r\n\r\nAlso, do some of the tooth labels with numbers in them\
      \ refer to teeth positionally instead of phylogenetically? For example, `pharyngobranchial\
      \ 2 tooth` is defined as `Tooth that is attached to the pharyngobranchial 2\
      \ tooth plate`, and ` pharyngobranchial 2 tooth plate` is defined as `Pharyngeal\
      \ tooth plate that lies ventral to pharyngobranchial 2 bone`. In this definition,\
      \ is `lies ventral to` meant to refer to the spatial location (or position)?"
    - "@megbalk, re:\r\n\r\n>It's based on an idea of homology for a tooth, where\
      \ the first tooth isn't arbitrary, it's the same tooth type that emerges in\
      \ that first position.\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to be how \"first\" is defined\
      \ in a term like \"first position\". Is this counted spatially (if so, what\
      \ is the coordinate framework) or developmentally/temporally? My recommendation\
      \ is to clarify what counting system is used somewhere in the class (definition,\
      \ comment)."
    - '@bvarner-ebi got it, can do. Should I add that to all the parent tooth terms

    - "> @bvarner-ebi got it, can do. Should I add that to all the parent tooth terms\
      \ (i.e., ones already in existence)?\r\n\r\nAdding to all parent terms with\

      \ would obviate potential confusion."
    - "@bvarner-ebi @wdduncan how is this for the revised definition (using molar\
      \ tooth 1 as an example): \r\n\r\nThe molar tooth of the upper or lower jaw\
      \ that is phylogenetically and developmentally in position 1, counting from\
      \ the rostral-most to the caudal-most."
    - Does "developmentally in position 1" mean that it is the first tooth of that
      type to erupt in the dentition and arch?
    - "@megbalk is correct, the number system is phylogenetic. This is the same for\
      \ other serial homologs in Uberon. We get less confused when it's the digits\
      \ as humans have the ancestral digits.\r\n\r\nApologies that this is not made\
      \ clearer, and also it's not entirely consistent due to different editors following\
      \ different practice:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nid: UBERON:0018302\r\nname: upper molar\
      \ 1\r\ndef: \"First molar (counting anteroposteriorly) in the upper jaw.\" [PHENOSCAPE:Alex]\r\
      \n\r\nid: UBERON:0018376\r\nname: molar tooth 1\r\ndef: \"The molar tooth of\
      \ the upper or lower jaw that is phylogenetically number 1.\" [UBERON:cjm]\r\
      \n```\r\n\r\nWe should stick with the phylogenetic system since Uberon is multispecies,\
      \ but we can change the specific wording if it's done consistently. E.g. \"\
      molar tooth 1 (phylogenetic)\". We should also place each such term into a DP.\r\
      \n\r\nI realize that these names are not ideals for users who want a human anatomy,\
      \ but the solution here is to tag the preferred synonym, then when we make the\
      \ human view we can substitute these for the primary label. E.g.\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\
      \nid: UBERON:0018377\r\nname: molar tooth 3\r\ndef: \"The molar tooth of the\
      \ upper or lower jaw that is phylogenetically number 3.\" [UBERON:cjm]\r\n...\r\
      \nsynonym: \"wisdom tooth\" RELATED HUMAN_PREFERRED [NCBITaxon:9606]\r\n```"
    - '@cmungall Yes. I understand your point about UBERON being multi-species and
      that the labels shouldn''t be necessarily geared towards human anatomy. My question
      concerned clarification about the meaning of "phylogenetically number 1". I''m
      not familiar with phylogenetic numbering. Does it mean the first molar tooth
      to appear in the phylogenic tree?'
    - "> We should stick with the phylogenetic system since Uberon is multispecies,\r\
      \n\r\n@cmungall, even if it Uberon covers multiple species, can you provide\
      \ context as to why numbering a tooth phylogenetically opposed to a anatomical\
      \ position is preferred? Anterior, rostral, caudal, etc are species-agnostic\
      \ terms as far as I know and would not require a user to know about evolutionary\
      \ development in order to use the ontology. \r\n\r\nTo @wdduncan's point above,\
      \ does a phylogenetic numbering system exist? I could not find one after a cursory\
      \ online search, so will it be clear to users what the difference is from \"\
      phylogenetically number 1\" and \"phylogenetically number 2\", as an example?"
    - '@bvarner-ebi the reason to name them phylogenetically and not positionally
      is because some species can lack a specific tooth or teeth. For example, camels
      lack P1 and P2. If you call the first premolar one encounters P1 on a camel,
      that is confusing as it is actually the same as P3 in other mammals.'

      automatically one year from now if no action is taken.
    - I don't think we ever came to a conclusion, but I vote for keeping these parent
      tooth terms consistent with tooth terms that already exist.
    - "No ... we didn't come to a conclusion. \r\nThe positional information is important,\
      \ but runs into issues for cross species representation. However, not having\
      \ positional information, would limit the utility of using UBERON for studies\

    - This issue has not seen any activity in the past 6 months; it will be closed

    - "Lot's of conversation in this thread.\r\n\r\nWhat is the current pattern you\
      \ are referring to? Do you mean phylogenic numbering? If so, then I think it\

  - As mentioned in your comment, a ventricle is a hollow part of an organ (in this
    case the heart). That is why I chose "located in" as opposed to 'part of'.

  - I agree with you, just not sure if it is modelled that way in uberon (but i might
    be wrong) it's not super clear to me from a brief look, but I think if you trace
    back, it leads to something material.

  - 'Bealls list is pretty accepted by academics, though they do have frontiers in,

  - 'I think it will eventually hit the same problem conceptually, but part_of is
    a clear pattern and I think that would be safe. 100% agree that tricky modelling
    thing should be in a separate ticket and not delay this unnecessarily :) '

  - Thanks for sharing this, @shawntanzk. It's not an issue of being too much trouble;
    rather, there does not seem to be compelling evidence which detracts from the
    validity of this particular reference.
  - 'Don''t have an issue with the reference itself, just the journal. It is hard
    to draw a line on if a journal is predatory so its tricky. I mean even nature
    does participate in some practices I would consider predatory (e.g. scientific
    reports) , yet these journals have really good papers in them. I think its partly
    my "spider senses" that tingled so I went to look the publisher up, and bealls
    list tends to be the first place to do so. Anyway here''s the wiki page that might
    have some more evidence (with citations in them) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juniper_Publishers. '

      \ zone. [https://myhealth.alberta.ca/Health/Pages/conditions.aspx?hwid=stt11635].\
      \ The endocervical canal is lined with glandular epithelium, and the ectocervix\
      \ is lined with squamous epithelium. The squamous epithelium meets the glandular\
      \ epithelium at the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ). The SCJ is dynamic and moves\
      \ during early adolescence and during a first pregnancy. The original SCJ originates\
      \ in the endocervical canal, but as the cervix everts during these times, the\
      \ SCJ comes to lie on the ectocervix and becomes the new SCJ. In colposcopy\
      \ terminology, the SCJ is this new SCJ. The epithelium between these two SCJs\
      \ is the TZ or transition zone, and its position is also variable. It may be\
      \ small or large and usually becomes more ectocervical during a woman\u2019\

  - Can you also add a part-of? Is this part of the meninges or overlaying it? I think
    there is only a single meninx in this clade, yes?
  - "as mentioned separately, this should have been caught by our pipeline and the\
    \ PR flagged. Nothing can be only in molluscs and fish.\r\n\r\nI wonder if we\

  - is ovarian fluid only secreted in fish?
  - "Wikipedia is sometimes a decent source proxy but in this case the wikipedia page\
    \ is not really helpful and is more about culinary aspects.\r\n\r\nTo what extend\
    \ is a new concept really required here vs just having a synonym on seminal fluid?\r\
    \n\r\nHaving terms that group across phyla is often a sign we want two different\

    \ general concept.\r\n\r\ncc @ddooley"

  - "@cmungall I let you decide what is more correct:\r\n1) add as synonym of seminal\
    \ fluid. \r\nIs possible to indicate that is a synonym/term used in fish?\r\n\
    2) create a new concept. \r\nIs this def. better?\r\n\"Secretion from the glands\

    ''in taxon'' some Actinopterygii and give it up Mollusca?'
  - '@cmungall OK, I will change to one of these'

  pr_closed_issues:
  - issue_body: "Uberon is inconsistent in the way it distinguishes between anatomical\
      \ entities that are made of parts that are all connected to each other (hereafter\
      \ \u201Cconnected entities\u201D) and entities that are made of parts that are\
      \ not necessarily all connected (hereafter \u201Cnon-connected entities\u201D\
      ).\r\n\r\nThis does not cause any obvious problems within Uberon itself, only\
      \ because the distinction between these two kinds of entities is not strictly\
      \ enforced. This does, however, cause problem when Uberon is merged with FBbt\
      \ (as happens e.g. in Ubergraph), because FBbt does enforce a strict separation\
      \ between connected and non-connected entities.\r\n\r\nIn FBbt, we have:\r\n\
      * `anatomical structure` for anatomical entities made of connected parts, and\r\
      \n* `disconnected anatomical group` for anatomical entities made of non-connected\
      \ parts (this used to be called `anatomical group` \u2013 it was recently renamed\
      \ to add the \u201Cdisconnected\u201D qualifier to make it more apparent that\
      \ it is a non-connected entity).\r\n\r\nMany of FBbt\u2019s classes are below\
      \ one of those two classes. We also have a disjointness axiom between them,\
      \ so that nothing can be simultaneously made of parts that are all connected\
      \ and made of parts that are not all connected.\r\n\r\nUberon is superficially\
      \ similar to FBbt in that it also has:\r\n* `anatomical structure` for entities\
      \ made of connected parts;\r\n* `disconnected anatomical group` for entities\
      \ made of non-connected parts.\r\n\r\nHowever, several terms are classified\
      \ under `anatomical structure` even though they clearly refer to entities that\
      \ are _not_ made of connected parts. Many of those terms are mapped to equivalent\
      \ FBbt terms, which then results in unsatisfiable classes upon merging Uberon\
      \ and FBbt.\r\n\r\nThe main offenders are:\r\n* `non-connected functional system`:\
      \ the label itself clearly indicates this is a non-connected entity, however\
      \ this is classified as a `anatomical system`, which is itself a `anatomical\
      \ structure` (so a connected entity);\r\n* `insect non-connected developing\
      \ system`: again, that\u2019s clearly a non-connected entity, but is classified\
      \ as a `anatomical group`, which is a `anatomical structure` (so a connected\
      \ entity);\r\n* `insect synaptic neuropil block`: defined as a \u201Cclosely\
      \ associated group of synaptic neuropil domains\u201D, suggesting it should\
      \ be a non-connected entity (the equivalent FBbt term is indeed a non-connected\
      \ entity), but classified as a `anatomical group` (so a connected entity);\r\
      \n* `insect synaptic neuropil`: classified in Uberon as a `anatomical group`\
      \ (so a connected entity), but the corresponding FBbt term is classified as\
      \ a more generic `anatomical entity`, which states nothing about the \u201C\
      connectedness\u201D of the entity (we have subclasses for both connected and\
      \ non-connected neuropils);\r\n* `anatomical cluster`: textually defined as\
      \ a \u201Canatomical group that has its parts adjacents to one another\u201D\
      , but classified as a `anatomical entity` which states nothing about the \u201C\
      connectedness\u201D; the equivalent FBbt term is classified as a `disconnected\
      \ anatomical group`, which I believe is correct (if we accept that \u201Cadjacents\u201D\
      \ does not imply \u201Cconnected\u201D);\r\n* `sensory system`: defined as the\
      \ \u201Canatomical system that overlaps the nervous system and is responsible\
      \ for receiving and processing sensory informations\u201D, which does not say\
      \ a lot about the connectedness, but has exact synonym \u201Cset of sense organs\u201D\
      , which to me suggests it should be a disconnected entity (the various sense\
      \ organs are not all connected to each other) \u2013 but `anatomical system`\
      \ is a `anatomical structure`, which makes `sensory system` a connected entity;\r\
      \n* `endocrine system`: exactly the same situation as for `sensory system`.\r\
      \n\r\nProposed actions:\r\n- re-classify `non-connected functional system` as\
      \ a `disconnected anatomical group`, to make it a non-connected entity as it\
      \ should be;\r\n- likewise for `insect non-connected developing system` and\
      \ `insect synaptic neuropil block`;\r\n- re-classify `insect synaptic neuropil`\
      \ to `material anatomical entity`, so that the classification does not imply\
      \ either a \u201Cconnected\u201D or a \u201Cnon-connected\u201D status (as in\
      \ FBbt);\r\n- re-classify `anatomical cluster` as a `disconnected anatomical\
      \ group`;\r\n- possibly obsolete `anatomical group`, which is currently only\
      \ used as a superclass of `insect non-connected developing system`, `insect\
      \ synaptic neuropil block`, and `insect synaptic neuropil` \u2013 and therefore\
      \ would end up with no children once those terms are re-classified as proposed;\r\
      \n- re-classify `sensory system` and `endocrine system` as `non-connected functional\
      \ system`.\r\n\r\nOf note, there are probably other subclasses of `anatomical\
      \ system` that should probably also be re-classified as `non-connected functional\
      \ system`, here I only listed those that cause problems upon merging Uberon\
      \ and FBbt. More generally, `anatomical system` is defined as a \u201C_connected_\
      \ anatomical structure that has multiple organs as parts\u201D. I am not sure\
      \ all the systems that are currently under `anatomical system` are all made\
      \ of _connected_ parts \u2013 at the very least for example, `immune system`\
      \ should probably be a `non-connected functional system`."

    - "Thanks for sharing, @anitacaron.\r\n\r\nI am curious about the object property\
      \ ['extend_fibers_into'](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/uberon/core#extends_fibers_into).\
      \ Based on the text of the label alone (I do not see a definition), and searching\
      \ a few other relationships in Uberon, this suggests that fibres are originating\
      \ from object X (in this case the 'cranial ganglion') and extending into object\
      \ Y (the 'glossopharyngeal nerve'). In this example, it is opposite to the anatomy.\
      \ The 'otic ganglion' [**receives** fibres from the 'glossopharyngeal nerve'](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/otic-ganglion?lang=gb).\
      \ \r\n\r\nMy question is:  does 'extend_fibers_into' denote some sort of afferent/efferent\
      \ direction? If not, then this axiom seems OK, although I recommend adding a\
      \ text definition to 'extends_fibers_into\" to make that clear. On the other\
      \ hand, if 'extend_fibers_into' denotes direction and/or the presence of a synapse,\
      \ this would need to be remodelled and the proposed solution may need to be\
      \ reconsidered.\r\n\r\nAnd, so we are on the same page, I had a look at the\
      \ [linked comment](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2495#issuecomment-1187364719):\r\
      \n\r\n> (I'm sure very many ganglia also have whole cells) \r\n\r\nA ganglion\
      \ contains nerve cell bodies, which are portions of cells. My understanding\
      \ is that ganglia do not contain whole cells, so if the above statement is true,\
      \ an example would be helpful."

  - "Hi, @megbalk, the wiktionary definition I see is:\r\n\r\n\"([anatomy](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anatomy))\
    \ The [posteriormost](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/posteriormost) point in the\
    \ [midsagittal](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/midsagittal) plane of the [occiput](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/occiput)\"\
    \r\nThis definition aligns with the images (of human skulls) I see with a cursory\
    \ online search.\r\n\r\nI am not familiar with the term \"nuchodorsal\" and could\
    \ not find a definition online. Even so, this point does not appear to be part\
    \ of the foramen magnum, at least not in humans."
  - '@bvarner-ebi thank you for checking. The definition comes from von den Driesch
    1979. I''ll find other definitions, then, to make sure that it is more broad and
    applicable.'
  - "The definition [here](https://locatelambda.org/manual/) has the opisthion and\
    \ the opisthocranion, which point is on the skin, not a bone (but paleontologists\
    \ define it on the skull). \r\n\r\nI will change this to be the opposite side\
    \ from the glabella on the skull.\r\n\r\nI must've gotten this confused with the\
    \ opisthion, and so would also like to make that term."
  - "Hi, @megbalk,\r\nTo consider: add mention that the point exists in the midline\
    \ since that appears in all the definitions referenced that I can see. \r\nPlease\
    \ also add dbxref (probably just the URL) that supports this text definition."
  - "Cannot access the ISBN reference to confirm.\r\nAlso, I'm trying to reconcile\
    \ the comment with the text definition. Is the opisthocranion located on the surface\
    \ of the skull in all species other than pigs?"
  - Is there a dbxref to support this?
  - Given the comment on pig anatomy, is this always true?
  - "Definition from https://locatelambda.org/manual/:\r\n\"Midline point at the posterior\
    \ margin of the foramen magnum.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"superior border\" would cover move\
    \ area than a specific point. I think \"midline\" and \"posterior\" are significant\
    \ defining words that should be included in text definition.\r\n"
  - It is in the line of the occipital bone, but not on it. Do you recommend omitting
    the logical definition?
  - After looking at other terms for anatomical points and lines in Uberon, I think
    it is fair to keep this assuming an  opisthocranion does not exist in the absence
    of some 'occipital bone'.
  - I removed the logical definition

      \ cases. Here are my 2 remaining issues.\r\n\r\n1. The SPARQL tests do not test\
      \ if there is a Id1:name/id2: EXACT synonym discrepancy (only synonym vs synonym).\
      \ Such a case was handled by PR #2470 where the label of UBERON:0002576 (temporal\
      \ pole) was exact synonym of UBERON:0006479\r\n\r\n2. The tests are not case\
      \ insensitive so nV != NV. I understand this is a much harder sell but consider\
      \ that a) for applications like text mining a case insensitive search is often\
      \ preferred and b) a case insensitive class often reveals a hasty abbreviation.\r\

    - Ok, @vasvir now that you are almost there, can you also do the PR to add the
      check to Uberon? @anitacaron can you advice @vasvir how to do it (don't do it
      yourself!)
    - "yea I would love to.\r\n\r\nTwo more questions...\r\n\r\n1. Can you tell me\
      \ where **duplicate_exact_synonym** query is located in the UBERON tree because\
      \ for the life of me can't seem to find it. Is it on a docker image outside\
      \ UBERON scope?\r\n\r\n2. Assuming it is merged it will break UBERON builds\
      \ with 3 (6) new errors. Shouldn't I handle them first?\r\n"
    - "ok of course I figured it out after posting.\r\n\r\n1. SPARQL scripts are in\
      \ src/sparql\r\n2. and there is enough machinery there to start the new checks\
      \ as a **warning** and then upgrade it to **error** where there are no errors."
    - "Hi @vasvir! Replaying your questions above:\r\n\r\n1. __duplicate_exact_synonym__\
      \ is part of the ROBOT report, and it leaves in the robot tool. Here's the exactly\
      \ SPARQL query that is used to generate this report. https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/duplicate_exact_synonym.\
      \ The complete list is [here.](https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/)\r\
      \n2. The branch is only merged if all QC passes. The QC will not pass if the\
      \ custom SPARQL query check returns some value, and the branch cannot be merged\
      \ until the problem is solved.\r\n\r\nI'll write down in the documentation the\
      \ instructions to include a custom SPARQL query check to UBERON."
    - "Thanks for the quick reply @anitacaron \r\n\r\nI will wait for the documentation\
      \ but looks like I have to try to send PRs that handle the issues highlighted\
      \ by this new SPARQL test before any merging can happen.\r\n\r\nHmm! Do you\
      \ think I should strive for merging to robot instead? There is even an issue\
      \ that is exactly that: https://github.com/ontodev/robot/issues/607 and @matentzn\
      \ has been there...\r\n"
    - For more transparency and documentation, it would be better if you first create
      a PR with the new custom SPARQL check and then, after seeing the checks are
      not passing, create each PR to fix them, and link to the PR with the SPARQL
      check.
    - "Here are quick instructions on how to create a violation check:\r\n\r\n###\
      \ Steps to add a constraint violation check:\r\n1. Add the SPARQL query in `src/sparql`.\
      \ The file's name should end with `-violation.sparql`. Please give a name that\
      \ helps understand the violation the query wants to check.\r\n1. Add the name\
      \ of the new file to odk configuration file `src/ontology/uberon-odk.yaml`:\r\
      \n    1. Include the file's name (without the `-violation.sparql` part) to the\
      \ list inside the `custom_sparql_checks` key, part of the `robot_report` key.\r\
      \n\r\n3. Update the repository so the ODK will include the new SPARQL check\
      \ in the QC.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen\
      \ you can create a PR, and the QC will run the new SPARQL check."

      \ if there is a Id1:name/id2: EXACT synonym discrepancy (only synonym vs synonym).\
      \ Such a case was handled by PR #2470 where the label of UBERON:0002576 (temporal\
      \ pole) was exact synonym of UBERON:0006479\r\n\r\n2. The tests are not case\
      \ insensitive so nV != NV. I understand this is a much harder sell but consider\
      \ that a) for applications like text mining a case insensitive search is often\
      \ preferred and b) a case insensitive class often reveals a hasty abbreviation.\r\

    - Ok, @vasvir now that you are almost there, can you also do the PR to add the
      check to Uberon? @anitacaron can you advice @vasvir how to do it (don't do it
      yourself!)
    - "yea I would love to.\r\n\r\nTwo more questions...\r\n\r\n1. Can you tell me\
      \ where **duplicate_exact_synonym** query is located in the UBERON tree because\
      \ for the life of me can't seem to find it. Is it on a docker image outside\
      \ UBERON scope?\r\n\r\n2. Assuming it is merged it will break UBERON builds\
      \ with 3 (6) new errors. Shouldn't I handle them first?\r\n"
    - "ok of course I figured it out after posting.\r\n\r\n1. SPARQL scripts are in\
      \ src/sparql\r\n2. and there is enough machinery there to start the new checks\
      \ as a **warning** and then upgrade it to **error** where there are no errors."
    - "Hi @vasvir! Replaying your questions above:\r\n\r\n1. __duplicate_exact_synonym__\
      \ is part of the ROBOT report, and it leaves in the robot tool. Here's the exactly\
      \ SPARQL query that is used to generate this report. https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/duplicate_exact_synonym.\
      \ The complete list is [here.](https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/)\r\
      \n2. The branch is only merged if all QC passes. The QC will not pass if the\
      \ custom SPARQL query check returns some value, and the branch cannot be merged\
      \ until the problem is solved.\r\n\r\nI'll write down in the documentation the\
      \ instructions to include a custom SPARQL query check to UBERON."
    - "Thanks for the quick reply @anitacaron \r\n\r\nI will wait for the documentation\
      \ but looks like I have to try to send PRs that handle the issues highlighted\
      \ by this new SPARQL test before any merging can happen.\r\n\r\nHmm! Do you\
      \ think I should strive for merging to robot instead? There is even an issue\
      \ that is exactly that: https://github.com/ontodev/robot/issues/607 and @matentzn\
      \ has been there...\r\n"
    - For more transparency and documentation, it would be better if you first create
      a PR with the new custom SPARQL check and then, after seeing the checks are
      not passing, create each PR to fix them, and link to the PR with the SPARQL
      check.
    - "Here are quick instructions on how to create a violation check:\r\n\r\n###\
      \ Steps to add a constraint violation check:\r\n1. Add the SPARQL query in `src/sparql`.\
      \ The file's name should end with `-violation.sparql`. Please give a name that\
      \ helps understand the violation the query wants to check.\r\n1. Add the name\
      \ of the new file to odk configuration file `src/ontology/uberon-odk.yaml`:\r\
      \n    1. Include the file's name (without the `-violation.sparql` part) to the\
      \ list inside the `custom_sparql_checks` key, part of the `robot_report` key.\r\
      \n\r\n3. Update the repository so the ODK will include the new SPARQL check\
      \ in the QC.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen\
      \ you can create a PR, and the QC will run the new SPARQL check."

    - "@vasvir, thank you for working on this.\r\n\r\nThere are two things to consider\

      \ is not a problem however, because we can help you migrate your test to SPARQL\
      \ instead, once we understand it.\r\n2. I don't yet understand what ploysemy\

    - "```\r\nsh run.sh make robot_reports\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you have docker installed!"
    - "Thanks a lot @matentzn  That covers a lot of ground.\r\n\r\nI managed to run\
      \ it and everything comes out nicely. The existing checks cover the 99% of the\
      \ cases. Here are my 2 remaining issues.\r\n\r\n1. The SPARQL tests do not test\
      \ if there is a Id1:name/id2: EXACT synonym discrepancy (only synonym vs synonym).\
      \ Such a case was handled by PR #2470 where the label of UBERON:0002576 (temporal\
      \ pole) was exact synonym of UBERON:0006479\r\n\r\n2. The tests are not case\
      \ insensitive so nV != NV. I understand this is a much harder sell but consider\
      \ that a) for applications like text mining a case insensitive search is often\
      \ preferred and b) a case insensitive class often reveals a hasty abbreviation.\r\
      \n\r\nSo if there is any interest I am prepared to give them a try."

    - Ok, @vasvir now that you are almost there, can you also do the PR to add the
      check to Uberon? @anitacaron can you advice @vasvir how to do it (don't do it
      yourself!)
    - "yea I would love to.\r\n\r\nTwo more questions...\r\n\r\n1. Can you tell me\
      \ where **duplicate_exact_synonym** query is located in the UBERON tree because\
      \ for the life of me can't seem to find it. Is it on a docker image outside\
      \ UBERON scope?\r\n\r\n2. Assuming it is merged it will break UBERON builds\
      \ with 3 (6) new errors. Shouldn't I handle them first?\r\n"
    - "ok of course I figured it out after posting.\r\n\r\n1. SPARQL scripts are in\
      \ src/sparql\r\n2. and there is enough machinery there to start the new checks\
      \ as a **warning** and then upgrade it to **error** where there are no errors."
    - "Hi @vasvir! Replaying your questions above:\r\n\r\n1. __duplicate_exact_synonym__\
      \ is part of the ROBOT report, and it leaves in the robot tool. Here's the exactly\
      \ SPARQL query that is used to generate this report. https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/duplicate_exact_synonym.\
      \ The complete list is [here.](https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/)\r\
      \n2. The branch is only merged if all QC passes. The QC will not pass if the\
      \ custom SPARQL query check returns some value, and the branch cannot be merged\
      \ until the problem is solved.\r\n\r\nI'll write down in the documentation the\
      \ instructions to include a custom SPARQL query check to UBERON."
    - "Thanks for the quick reply @anitacaron \r\n\r\nI will wait for the documentation\
      \ but looks like I have to try to send PRs that handle the issues highlighted\
      \ by this new SPARQL test before any merging can happen.\r\n\r\nHmm! Do you\
      \ think I should strive for merging to robot instead? There is even an issue\
      \ that is exactly that: https://github.com/ontodev/robot/issues/607 and @matentzn\
      \ has been there...\r\n"
    - For more transparency and documentation, it would be better if you first create
      a PR with the new custom SPARQL check and then, after seeing the checks are
      not passing, create each PR to fix them, and link to the PR with the SPARQL
      check.
    - "Here are quick instructions on how to create a violation check:\r\n\r\n###\
      \ Steps to add a constraint violation check:\r\n1. Add the SPARQL query in `src/sparql`.\
      \ The file's name should end with `-violation.sparql`. Please give a name that\
      \ helps understand the violation the query wants to check.\r\n1. Add the name\
      \ of the new file to odk configuration file `src/ontology/uberon-odk.yaml`:\r\
      \n    1. Include the file's name (without the `-violation.sparql` part) to the\
      \ list inside the `custom_sparql_checks` key, part of the `robot_report` key.\r\
      \n\r\n3. Update the repository so the ODK will include the new SPARQL check\
      \ in the QC.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen\
      \ you can create a PR, and the QC will run the new SPARQL check."

  - '@bvarner-ebi - could you help a bit with this. I saw that there is temporalis
    muscle in uberon (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001598) and this should
    have some relation to temple (I assume), but not 100% sure how it actually relates
    - would you mind adding the appropriate relation please? thanks :) '
  - '@shawntanzk, I would be inclined to model the muscle wrt to bones. I would not
    add a relation between the muscle and a body region unless you see examples of
    this in Uberon.'
  - Consider "posterior" in place of "behind", but not sure if this holds true in
    all species.
  - 'perhaps then adding bone relation to temple? Just thought ideally that muscle
    should have a relation to temple given the name, but if you think otherwise that''s
    fine too :) '
  - "@bvarner-ebi OK, I will correct to \"posterior\". \r\n@bvarner-ebi what do you\
    \ mean with \"EDIT: but not sure if this holds true in all species.\"? "
  - "> perhaps then adding bone relation to temple?\r\n\r\nThis sounds reasonable\
    \ to me since the temple exists through the presence of the fused bones, not necessarily\
    \ the presence of the muscle."
  - You could add gloss regarding the muscle if you're keen on mentioning it.

    - '@matentzn @cmungall what is the best practice for renaming a term and creating
      a new term that has the same name (e.g., renaming "sagittal crest" to "sagittal
      crest of skull" and creating the term "sagittal crest")?'
    - 'The cleaner version is to deprecate the old and create two new terms. Sound

      \n\r\nBoth the text and the logical (`'part of' some 'dermatocranioum'`) definitions\
      \ of UBERON:0013447 unambiguously identify it as the sagittal crest on the skull\

      \ human/primate/mammalian anatomy biased) and consistent usage of this term\
      \ and term label in the field.\r\n\r\nThe currently defined class of UBERON:0013447\
      \ is not a union of the proposed generic `sagittal crest` and the existing `sagittal\

      \ any evidence for overlap in the usage of UBERON:0013447 with any other interpretations\

    - I presume this will help resolve that right now CARO terms "anatomical entity"
      and "anatomical structure" and "material anatomical entity" are in UBERON and
      have duplicate UBERON terms?  I have an automated ontofox import script that
      brings in both terms, and its a hassle to manually drop the CARO ones to reduce
      confusion.
    - '@ddooley I am going to propose that we obsolete the CARO ontology entirely,
      and maintain the pan-life layer at the top of Uberon. Mainly just to reduce
      confusion and facilitate maintenance. Any thoughts on that idea?'
    - +1, between Uberon and COB is there any need for CARO anymore?
    - Sounds great to me!
    - Added [anatomical conduit space](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0013686)
      to the subset.
    - This issue has not seen any activity in the past 6 months; it will be closed
      automatically one year from now if no action is taken.

    \ any point along the line described in the first sentence of the definition.\
    \ \r\n\r\nI'm not familiar with \"oral\" being used for anatomical orientation\

  - "Based on my understanding of the definition for 'prosthion', it is a point on\
    \ a line derived from landmarks on the premaxilla and in some cases is \"projected\

  - I thin it is because CARO anatomical point is different from UBERON anatomical
    point. I can change it to be CARO?
  - "The definition should define the location of the point exactly if this term refers\
    \ to a specific point location -- based on what I've found, it has a specific\
    \ location, being located in the median plane as opposed to being just somewhere\
    \ along the described line.\r\n\r\nHere are the two most straightforward definitions\

    \ midline on the alveolar process of the maxilla\r\nhttps://www.vocabulary.com/dictionary/alveolar%20point"
  - i found one that said "rostral" which I liked
  - "@megbalk, I've only seen \"anterior\" used in the definitions I found. As this\
    \ point can project into space as noted in your comment, I would think \"anterior\"\
    \ would be more applicable. If you want to stay with \"rostral\", can you add\
    \ the dbxref that supports it?\r\n\r\n> {comment=\"DOI:10.1002/ar.a.10052\"}\r\
    \n\r\nShould this be a dbxref?"
  - "Comma after \"Often\" should be removed since removing the word \"Often\" would\
    \ change the meaning of the sentence.\r\n\r\nIn the second sentence, I think \"\
    it\" should be \"is\".\r\nComment should have dbxref annotations (I think that\

  - This can just be smooth muscle tissue, instead of aorta smooth muscle tissue (tends
    to be better practice to let the reasoner do the work - not in this case but some
    times you might miss some things that reasoner would handle and all) - same applies
    to all your other terms
  - I wonder if it's worth adding `placental artery` (and I guess vein by that logic).
    That would give it the same pattern as your other terms which would be useful
    if we decide to implement patterns in uberon.
  - OK, thanks. I will correct all the terms and send a pull request again
  - "OK. I will create placental artery and placental vein.\r\n@shawntanzk should\
    \ I keep placental artery endothelium child of placenta blood vessel or make it\
    \ child of placental artery?"
  - Consider replacing "at" with "that is part of" to match your axiom below.
  - '@bvarner-ebi thanks for your teaching, this is the tip of the iceberg :-). Question:
    after making all the changes should I remove this pull request and start a new
    one?'
  - "@paulacalipho, no, there is no need to start a new pull request. Once you make\
    \ and save your changes in Prot\xE9g\xE9, then **commit** and **push** those changes\
    \ with GitHub Desktop. That will update this pull request."
  - '@shawntanzk : should I change also ''endothelium of vein'' and (''part of'' some
    ''iliac vein'') to endothelium and (''part of'' some ''iliac vein'')?'
  - 'yes, all of the terms should be something like that :) '
  - "it should follow the pattern of all the other terms, so: \r\nequivalent: endothelium\
    \ and (\"part of\" some \"placental artery\")"
  - sorry, would you mind adding placental vein too? I think if I rmbr right, the
    modeling would make it so that this is will be the only child of placenta blood
    vessel which is not great (see https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2022/01/04/ontotip-avoid-the-single-child-anti-pattern/)

    - "Also noting that 'genital system' appears on the list in [this ticket](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2171).\r\
      \n\r\n@balhoff, no, I don't think so. The definition of XAO:0000142 'genital\
      \ system' is class agnostic:\r\n\"Anatomical system that has as its parts the\
      \ organs concerned with reproduction\"\r\n\r\nWikipedia states (albeit without\
      \ a reference):\r\n\"The reproductive system of an organism, **also known as\
      \ the genital system**, is the biological system made up of all the anatomical\
      \ organs involved in sexual reproduction\"\r\n\r\n'genital system' and 'reproductive\
      \ system' were separate terms in Uberon, but perhaps they should not have been,\
      \ as @cmungall notes above and in #2514. I tried to disambiguate the two by\
      \ making the text definition of 'genital system':\r\n\r\nAnatomical system that\
      \ has as its parts the organs concerned with reproduction, **especially the\
      \ external genital organs**\r\n\r\nbut I don't think this was the best course\

      \ system' and 'reproductive system'.** Is that the plan @balhoff, @cmungall,\
      \ @dosumis ?\r\n"
    - "I think the key question is whether [reproductive system](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2493)\
      \ is broader than genitalia (we have terms for internal and external genitalia,\
      \ but not the grouping term - genital system is the closest we have to that).\r\

      \n\r\nWe have terms under reproductive system that I don't think anyone would\
      \ consider genitalia, e.g. \r\n\r\ncotylephore\r\n[http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2002114\

      \ an attachment site for embryos. [ TAO : wd ]\r\n\r\n[ovipositor](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2002117)\r\
      \n\r\nWould reproductive system also include specialised structures involved\
      \ in mating e.g. sex combs on the front legs of some insects?  What about glands\
      \ secreting sex phereomones?\r\n\r\nSuggested fix:  Genital system -> genitalia\
      \ becomes grouping term for internal & external genitalia + gonad? (which doesn't\
      \ currently appear to be under genitalia)\r\n "
    - I'd drop the broad synonyms recently added and make genital system and extact
      synonym of genitalia.  The 'reproductive system' broad synonym should go, as
      we shouldn't duplicate a superclass name as a synonym.

    - FYI @mfutey.
    - 'You perhaps weren''t to know this but I think the correct course of action
      here was to merge genital system. See #2514'
    - "@cmungall, do you mean merge 'genital system' with 'reproductive system'?\r\
      \n\r\nFYI @dosumis "
    - Is 'genital system' just amphibian-specific terminology for reproductive system?
      https://www.ontobee.org/ontology/XAO?iri=http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/XAO_0000142
    - "Also noting that 'genital system' appears on the list in [this ticket](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2171).\r\
      \n\r\n@balhoff, no, I don't think so. The definition of XAO:0000142 'genital\
      \ system' is class agnostic:\r\n\"Anatomical system that has as its parts the\
      \ organs concerned with reproduction\"\r\n\r\nWikipedia states (albeit without\
      \ a reference):\r\n\"The reproductive system of an organism, **also known as\
      \ the genital system**, is the biological system made up of all the anatomical\
      \ organs involved in sexual reproduction\"\r\n\r\n'genital system' and 'reproductive\
      \ system' were separate terms in Uberon, but perhaps they should not have been,\
      \ as @cmungall notes above and in #2514. I tried to disambiguate the two by\
      \ making the text definition of 'genital system':\r\n\r\nAnatomical system that\
      \ has as its parts the organs concerned with reproduction, **especially the\
      \ external genital organs**\r\n\r\nbut I don't think this was the best course\
      \ of action. \r\n\r\n**It seems the proper course of action is to merge 'genital\
      \ system' and 'reproductive system'.** Is that the plan @balhoff, @cmungall,\
      \ @dosumis ?\r\n"
    - "I think the key question is whether [reproductive system](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2493)\
      \ is broader than genitalia (we have terms for internal and external genitalia,\
      \ but not the grouping term - genital system is the closest we have to that).\r\
      \n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/112839/172811481-6c1b09ab-9ee2-42d6-8143-48d3e7e8f515.png)\r\
      \n\r\nWe have terms under reproductive system that I don't think anyone would\
      \ consider genitalia, e.g. \r\n\r\ncotylephore\r\n[http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2002114\
      \ ](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2002114) \r\nMulti-tissue structure\
      \ that is a transient outgrowth of tissue on skin brooding fish that acts as\
      \ an attachment site for embryos. [ TAO : wd ]\r\n\r\n[ovipositor](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_2002117)\r\
      \n\r\nWould reproductive system also include specialised structures involved\
      \ in mating e.g. sex combs on the front legs of some insects?  What about glands\
      \ secreting sex phereomones?\r\n\r\nSuggested fix:  Genital system -> genitalia\
      \ becomes grouping term for internal & external genitalia + gonad? (which doesn't\
      \ currently appear to be under genitalia)\r\n "
    - I'd drop the broad synonyms recently added and make genital system and extact
      synonym of genitalia.  The 'reproductive system' broad synonym should go, as
      we shouldn't duplicate a superclass name as a synonym.

    - "OK.  I think painless to merge - esp as this term had no children until very\

      \ is a way to limit the output for testing purposes.\r\n\r\nLet me educate my\

    - Ok, @vasvir now that you are almost there, can you also do the PR to add the
      check to Uberon? @anitacaron can you advice @vasvir how to do it (don't do it
      yourself!)
    - "yea I would love to.\r\n\r\nTwo more questions...\r\n\r\n1. Can you tell me\
      \ where **duplicate_exact_synonym** query is located in the UBERON tree because\
      \ for the life of me can't seem to find it. Is it on a docker image outside\
      \ UBERON scope?\r\n\r\n2. Assuming it is merged it will break UBERON builds\
      \ with 3 (6) new errors. Shouldn't I handle them first?\r\n"
    - "ok of course I figured it out after posting.\r\n\r\n1. SPARQL scripts are in\
      \ src/sparql\r\n2. and there is enough machinery there to start the new checks\
      \ as a **warning** and then upgrade it to **error** where there are no errors."
    - "Hi @vasvir! Replaying your questions above:\r\n\r\n1. __duplicate_exact_synonym__\
      \ is part of the ROBOT report, and it leaves in the robot tool. Here's the exactly\
      \ SPARQL query that is used to generate this report. https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/duplicate_exact_synonym.\
      \ The complete list is [here.](https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/)\r\
      \n2. The branch is only merged if all QC passes. The QC will not pass if the\
      \ custom SPARQL query check returns some value, and the branch cannot be merged\
      \ until the problem is solved.\r\n\r\nI'll write down in the documentation the\
      \ instructions to include a custom SPARQL query check to UBERON."
    - "Thanks for the quick reply @anitacaron \r\n\r\nI will wait for the documentation\
      \ but looks like I have to try to send PRs that handle the issues highlighted\
      \ by this new SPARQL test before any merging can happen.\r\n\r\nHmm! Do you\
      \ think I should strive for merging to robot instead? There is even an issue\
      \ that is exactly that: https://github.com/ontodev/robot/issues/607 and @matentzn\
      \ has been there...\r\n"
    - For more transparency and documentation, it would be better if you first create
      a PR with the new custom SPARQL check and then, after seeing the checks are
      not passing, create each PR to fix them, and link to the PR with the SPARQL
      check.
    - "Here are quick instructions on how to create a violation check:\r\n\r\n###\
      \ Steps to add a constraint violation check:\r\n1. Add the SPARQL query in `src/sparql`.\
      \ The file's name should end with `-violation.sparql`. Please give a name that\
      \ helps understand the violation the query wants to check.\r\n1. Add the name\
      \ of the new file to odk configuration file `src/ontology/uberon-odk.yaml`:\r\
      \n    1. Include the file's name (without the `-violation.sparql` part) to the\
      \ list inside the `custom_sparql_checks` key, part of the `robot_report` key.\r\
      \n\r\n3. Update the repository so the ODK will include the new SPARQL check\
      \ in the QC.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen\
      \ you can create a PR, and the QC will run the new SPARQL check."

      there will be probably more term request. I will be happy to learn how to add
      terms to the ontology myself, thanks for proposing
    - "@paulacalipho if you are interested in real training, I think your best bet\

      \ has it) to add you to the list of invites.\r\n\r\nHowever, training is a lengthy\
      \ process. In my experience with HPO, the best thing would be to provide @paulacalipho\
      \ with ROBOT templates to populate and add the terms, and have uberon core developers\
      \ deal with/review the logical axiomatisations where necessary. The best way\
      \ to make progress on that is:\r\n\r\n1. @paulacalipho creates a google sheet\
      \ with all the terms she need, one row per term.\r\n2. @shawntanzk and @bvarner-ebi\
      \ will add columns to the sheet and explain to @paulacalipho what needs to be\
      \ added\r\n3. @shawntanzk slurps the sheet into uberon-edit.obo using robot\
      \ template + merge.\r\n\r\nMy two cents. But, you are, in any case, welcome\

    present", which raises doubts as to whether all 3 types are always present). I
    did a quick Google search but I''m still unsure. Hence I''d personally be more
    comfortable with is_a rather than has_part. But I assume that you had evidence
    to go for has_part. If so, that''s fine by me! :-)  '

      \ is not a problem however, because we can help you migrate your test to SPARQL\
      \ instead, once we understand it.\r\n2. I don't yet understand what ploysemy\
      \ you are checking. We have a ton of QC against it, like https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/duplicate_exact_synonym.\

      \ a current git checkout of the project?\r\n\r\nThanks for the quick reply.\r\

      \ it and everything comes out nicely. The existing checks cover the 99% of the\
      \ cases. Here are my 2 remaining issues.\r\n\r\n1. The SPARQL tests do not test\
      \ if there is a Id1:name/id2: EXACT synonym discrepancy (only synonym vs synonym).\
      \ Such a case was handled by PR #2470 where the label of UBERON:0002576 (temporal\
      \ pole) was exact synonym of UBERON:0006479\r\n\r\n2. The tests are not case\
      \ insensitive so nV != NV. I understand this is a much harder sell but consider\
      \ that a) for applications like text mining a case insensitive search is often\
      \ preferred and b) a case insensitive class often reveals a hasty abbreviation.\r\
      \n\r\nSo if there is any interest I am prepared to give them a try."

    - Ok, @vasvir now that you are almost there, can you also do the PR to add the
      check to Uberon? @anitacaron can you advice @vasvir how to do it (don't do it
      yourself!)
    - "yea I would love to.\r\n\r\nTwo more questions...\r\n\r\n1. Can you tell me\
      \ where **duplicate_exact_synonym** query is located in the UBERON tree because\
      \ for the life of me can't seem to find it. Is it on a docker image outside\
      \ UBERON scope?\r\n\r\n2. Assuming it is merged it will break UBERON builds\
      \ with 3 (6) new errors. Shouldn't I handle them first?\r\n"
    - "ok of course I figured it out after posting.\r\n\r\n1. SPARQL scripts are in\
      \ src/sparql\r\n2. and there is enough machinery there to start the new checks\
      \ as a **warning** and then upgrade it to **error** where there are no errors."
    - "Hi @vasvir! Replaying your questions above:\r\n\r\n1. __duplicate_exact_synonym__\
      \ is part of the ROBOT report, and it leaves in the robot tool. Here's the exactly\
      \ SPARQL query that is used to generate this report. https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/duplicate_exact_synonym.\
      \ The complete list is [here.](https://robot.obolibrary.org/report_queries/)\r\
      \n2. The branch is only merged if all QC passes. The QC will not pass if the\
      \ custom SPARQL query check returns some value, and the branch cannot be merged\
      \ until the problem is solved.\r\n\r\nI'll write down in the documentation the\
      \ instructions to include a custom SPARQL query check to UBERON."
    - "Thanks for the quick reply @anitacaron \r\n\r\nI will wait for the documentation\
      \ but looks like I have to try to send PRs that handle the issues highlighted\
      \ by this new SPARQL test before any merging can happen.\r\n\r\nHmm! Do you\
      \ think I should strive for merging to robot instead? There is even an issue\
      \ that is exactly that: https://github.com/ontodev/robot/issues/607 and @matentzn\
      \ has been there...\r\n"
    - For more transparency and documentation, it would be better if you first create
      a PR with the new custom SPARQL check and then, after seeing the checks are
      not passing, create each PR to fix them, and link to the PR with the SPARQL
      check.
    - "Here are quick instructions on how to create a violation check:\r\n\r\n###\
      \ Steps to add a constraint violation check:\r\n1. Add the SPARQL query in `src/sparql`.\
      \ The file's name should end with `-violation.sparql`. Please give a name that\
      \ helps understand the violation the query wants to check.\r\n1. Add the name\
      \ of the new file to odk configuration file `src/ontology/uberon-odk.yaml`:\r\
      \n    1. Include the file's name (without the `-violation.sparql` part) to the\
      \ list inside the `custom_sparql_checks` key, part of the `robot_report` key.\r\
      \n\r\n3. Update the repository so the ODK will include the new SPARQL check\
      \ in the QC.\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nsh run.sh make update_repo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen\
      \ you can create a PR, and the QC will run the new SPARQL check."

      \n\r\n'curator notes' \"A note of confusion is the difference between apocrine\
      \ secretion and apocrine sweat gland. Apocrine secretion refers to the apical\
      \ loss of a cell's membrane to create cell blebs, thus creating a secretory\
      \ product. Apocrine sweat gland refers to a structure, not a secretion process.\
      \ Apocrine sweat glands actually use a merocrine type secretion, or that mediated\
      \ by exocytosis of secretory granules. When 'apocrine gland' is used without\
      \ the word sweat, it is often referring to the gland which uses merocrine secretion,\
      \ and not the secretion method. The important difference in apocrine sweat gland\
      \ structure is its larger lumen, compared to the more narrow lumen of the eccrine\
      \ sweat gland.\"^^xsd:string\r\n\r\n"

    - "Having thought about the curator note here, I'm no longer sure the change is\
      \ required.  However, I  would like to find a way to avoid similar confusion\
      \ in future.\r\n\r\nWe should at least add a note to 'skin aprocrine gland'\
      \ to make it clear it **does not** cover aprocrine sweat glands of the skin.\
      \  I'd also be interested to see if we can add other examples of truly apocrine\
      \ glands of the skin (maybe from other animals).  Having a defined class with\
      \ no children is a bad smell."
    - "Notes for self:\r\n- [x] Add rdfs:comment to 'skin apocrine gland': \"Note\
      \ that 'skin apocrine gland' does not cover 'apocrine sweat gland': in the former,\

      \ it refers to a structural feature.\"\r\n- [ ] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK482199/\

      \ of 'skin apocrine gland' (including non-human examples).  "
    - Seems like GO should have a process for this secretion mechanism, but I couldn't
      find a term from a quick search of GO BP.  Maybe we should request one? It would
      be useful for defining glands/cells that use apocrine (decapitation) secretion
      mechanism.

      \n> \"Apocrine sweat glands were originally thought to use only apocrine secretion:\

  - issue_body: "In preparing material from the ferret brain to be added to Uberon\
      \ (issue #2352), we came across a possible error in UBERON brain design, or\
      \ at least a question on how to specify it. (@shawntanzk )\r\n\r\nIn some animals,\
      \ functional areas are grouped by their association with an anatomical feature\
      \ of the brain, such as a gyrus, sulcus, or lobe. We've run into a problem in\
      \ that these relationships are not invariant across species. For example, in\
      \ humans, primary visual cortex, secondary visual cortex, and visual association\
      \ cortex are all classified as \u201Cpart of\u201D visual cortex (UBERON_0000411),\
      \ where visual cortex is \u201Cpart of\u201D occipital cortex (UBERON_0016540).\
      \ \r\n\r\nHowever, in ferret, there exists several functional areas that should\
      \ be classified as \u201Cpart of\u201D visual cortex by their function, but\
      \ are located in temporal or parietal regions and thus should not be considered\
      \ \u201Cpart of\u201D occipital cortex.\r\n\r\nAs an example, ferret areas 20a\
      \ (temporal visual area a), 20b (temporal visual area b) and the posterior suprasylvian\
      \ area (PS) are identified as being \u201Ctemporal\u201D in their anatomical\
      \ position and have visual function (Manger, Nakamura, Valentiniene & Innocenti,\
      \ 2004; Hommona-Ludiye, Manger & Bourne, 2010).\r\n\r\nPresumably, the relationship\
      \ between \"visual cortex\" being \"part of\" \"occipital lobe\" comes from\
      \ the human or monkey, where most (but not all) of the visual areas are in the\
      \ occipital lobe.\r\n\r\nAs another example, the posterior parietal rostral\
      \ cortical area (PPr) and posterior parietal caudal area (PPc) are visual in\
      \ function and defined as being \u201Cparietal\u201D anatomically (Manger, Masiello\
      \ & Innocenti, 2002; Dell, Innocenti, Hilgetag, & Manger, 2019).\r\n\r\nHere\
      \ we are a little stuck. It would seem the right thing to do would be to somehow\
      \ clarify that \"visual cortex\" is \"part of\" \"occipital lobe\" only in humans\
      \ or primates. Ferrets don't have formal lobe definitions that we can uncover.\r\
      \n\r\nThe problem: if someone searches for all areas that are \u201Cpart of\u201D\
      \ occipital cortex, and if we say that these areas in ferret temporal cortex\
      \ are \u201Cpart of\u201D \u201Cvisual cortex\u201D, then, because \u201Cvisual\
      \ cortex\u201D is part of \u201Coccipital cortex\u201D, all of these ferret\
      \ temporal areas will be identified.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fix is to say \u201C\
      visual cortex\u201D \u201Coverlaps\u201D \"occipital cortex\u201D ?? That is\
      \ true in all mammals. That would be a big in the current UBERON for the big\
      \ sensory functional categories.\r\n\r\nAn alternative would be to modify it\
      \ so that being \"part of\" certain anatomical regions needs some sort of \"\
      in taxa\" modifier to be right. Is that a better way or is the better way to\
      \ say \u201Coverlaps\u201D?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n\r\n**Uberon term**\r\

    - I think that making function and region fully orthogonal is a good idea. The
      tendency to conflate the naming of a region with its apparent function is common
      in neuroanatomy, and leads to exactly the issue that @stevevanhooser describes
      here. Even more confusingly, there are likely to be cases where parts of the
      cortex in some species will be called "visual cortex" but it will be a regional
      name, and there will be areas in the same species that are "parts of cortex
      that participate in the visual system" (or some similar functional definition)
      which (as Steve points out) would not be part of the physical regional "visual
      cortex" but some "functionally visual cortex."
    - 'I think this is something worth spending some time discussing - I''ve placed
      this on the agenda for the next uberon call. This will come back again when
      looking into adding terms to fix some of the ABA-Uberon bridge mappings (https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/issues/2384).
      Something like auditory or visual area is in the brain atlas, and hence actually
      mapped to a spatial area, yet it would probably be more sensible to have them
      functionally defined. However if functionally defined, how do we define a difference
      between something like ventral auditory area and dorsal auditory area? '
    - "To address the integration of ferret visual areas as new terms in Uberon, Steve\
      \ and I discussed the use of a ferret specific preferred label (such as \u201C\
      ferret third visual area\u201D) rather than \u201Cthird visual cortical area\u201D\
      .  \r\n\r\nSimilar naming conventions have been used across species, generating\
      \ duplicate area names for areas that are not, or are not currently known to\
      \ be, homologous across said species. When defining synonyms for terms, we must\
      \ keep in mind that the direct relationships between these similarly named areas\
      \ in ferrets and other species are widely unknown and thus we cannot say that\
      \ the \u201Cferret third visual area\u201D is synonymous to \u201Carea 19\u201D\
      \ as it exists in Uberon, however we can say it is synonymous to \u201Cferret\
      \ area 19\u201D. Such clarifying language in the labels and synonyms would allow\
      \ the integration of these terms without implying that the ferret areas are\
      \ synonymous with existing entries.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we have utilized the\
      \ relation part of \u201Csome visual system\u201D and \u201Csome visual cortex\u201D\

    - I think we should only consider this if taxon specificity is explicit.
    - "Note: The only area in visual cortex that has clear homology across species\

    - Every examined mammal has a primary visual cortex (plenty of citations for this)
    - '@stevevanhooser perhaps a good middle ground solution is converting all the
      axioms in the primary visual cortex that are primate specific to taxon GCIs
      - would that work @cmungall? '
    - "note: primary visual cortex is HIGHLY specific to humans atm - it is a subclass\
      \ of Brodmann area which is human specific, and its definition and synonyms\
      \ suggest its human specific too. @dosumis & @cmungall - we probably need a\

      \ agenda for discussion next uberon call, but in the meantime would like a solution\
      \ so we can process the terms requested"
    - The Brodmann relationship probably comes from old modelling in NIF and is an
      artifact. Not sure what the best solution would be, but if there aren't any
      axioms then relaxing the constraints is probably the right thing to do rather
      than creating a more general class.

    - "@dosumis : I think the question of whether the general class should be \"part_of\

      \ species there haven't been parcellations, or if they have been, it's just\

    - (For example, the ferret brain has no commonly accepted division into "lobes"
      as does the macaque and human. One could certainly make up such a division,
      but there is no tradition of it in the literature.)
    - "The current definition of occipital lobe is sort of similar (Posterior part\

      here. @cthoyt  how would you formulate the test independently of the specific

    - "dont think I can be super helpful here, I have like ZERO idea bout fish let\
      \ alone their eyes.\r\nMy guess is that jugular vein part_of some neck is over-restrictive.\
      \ \r\nDid a quick search and it seems fish do indeed have jugular veins and\
      \ im guessing fishes don't have necks "
    - I would think removing the part_of neck would be the right thing to do, but
      I don't know how that would affect modelling, I'm guessing there's a reason
      that axiom is there? I guess inherent difficulty with multi-species anatomy
      ontology. Checked uberon, and the textual def doesn't mention neck too btws.
    - "> I would think removing the part_of neck would be the right thing to do\r\n\
      \r\nshall I do this in the branch @matentzn "
    - Can you branch off from my branch and then make a pr to the branch? Same with
      the other ticket. You may have to undo changes I made previously

- id: pr2347
  pr_body: "The two terms `clypeo-labral anlage in statu nascendi` and `visual anlage\
    \ in statu nascendi` are way too specific to belong in Uberon. Having the parental\
    \ term `insect anlage in statu nascendi` (mapped to the corresponding term in\
    \ FBbt) should be enough--anyone looking for a more precise term should go look\
    \ for the children of the FBbt term.\r\n\r\nObsoleting `clypeo-labral anlage in\
    \ statu nascendi` allows to remove the FBbt term `anterior ectoderm anlage`, which\
    \ was imported into Uberon since `clypeo-labral anlage in statu nascendi` has\
    \ a part_of relationship to it. (As stated in #2025, we do not want any Uberon\
    \ term to have any kind of relationship to a species-specific foreign ontology.)\r\
    \n\r\nObsoleting these two terms has cascading consequences:\r\n\r\n* `insect\
    \ clypeo-labral anlage` is the starting point of a chain of `develops_from` relationships\
    \ that goes up to `insect clypeus`;\r\n* similarly, `insect visual anlage in statu\
    \ nascendi` is the starting point of a chain that goes up to `insect Bolwig organ`.\r\
    \n\r\nIt is doubtful that all these terms are really useful, but I don\u2019t\
    \ want to obsolete them all for now, so this PR simply breaks the chains at their\
    \ beginnings by removing the first `develops_from` axioms. Deciding what to do\
    \ with all the \"insect anlage\" and \"insect primordium\" terms will need to\
    \ be done later (probably as part of a larger review of all the 6xxxxxx terms).\r\

      \ copying here as a quick reminder to take a look:\r\n\r\nLooking at the asserted\
      \ children of 'anatomical junction', \r\n- [x] I wonder if 'perineal body' is\
      \ indeed a junction (def says it's located at a junction, which doesn't necessarily\
      \ make it a junction?)\r\n- [x] should 'angle of oral opening' be better axiomatised?\r\
      \n- [x] 'esophagogastric junction' is axiomatised differently from its siblings;\
      \ \r\n- [x] and there may be a few more classes needing work? (I focused on\
      \ the ones that don't have 'connects' axioms, but didn't look at them all.)"

    - "@cmungall (and/or anyone else who'd be willing to double-check some human-centric\
      \ anatomy terms)\r\nI edited the placement of some former asserted children\
      \ of 'anatomical junction' that didn't look like strict junctions to me. Tagging\
      \ you as some of those terms were added by you. I went ahead and merged as I\
      \ think those changes are fairly safe and I'm aware of the demands on your time.\
      \ I'll leave this ticket open for some time in case you or others wish to comment\
      \ on [these edits](https://github.com/obophenotype/uberon/commit/dfa7f05e3baf827a7f73ab9eb0dd2d9bdc99eaba),\

    - There have been no objections, so I'll close now.

      \ in my spam.  Yes this is a tricky one and probably have folks on both sides\
      \ of the aisle.  The definition in Uberon states it is part of medulla https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FUBERON_0001284&viewMode=PreferredRoots&siblings=false\
      \ while the anatomical tree is showing as part of cortex because it is extension\
      \ of outer cortex diving deep into the kidney all the way to the pelvis.  Histologically,\
      \ this is pretty similar to cortical tissue so many for that reason may call\
      \ it cortex.  But traditionally we mark the kidney in 2 regions, cortex (outer)\
      \ and medulla (inner part).  So anatomically this would be in the inner part\
      \ between the medullary pyramids.  But then we have interlobar vessels that\
      \ run between the medullary pyramid and the renal columns so what should we\
      \ call them to be anatomically a part of.  And then Uberon defines renal medulla\
      \ to be synonymous with renal pyramids.  Most people talking about renal medulla\
      \ actually are really implying renal pyramids, and when talking about cortex,\
      \ it is the cortical arch that is being referred to.  So this comes to your\
      \ question, if we say cortex what cell types will we expect to see there, and\
      \ same for medulla.   So how do we reconcile these conflicting issues of regional\
      \ anatomy and histology and common usage.  It is sort of what we struggled with\
      \ separating renal corpuscle from glomerulus.  One could be more precise and\
      \ say cortical arch, medullary pyramid, renal column as anatomical references\
      \ in the human kidney.   Any way we can discuss what the ontologists suggest\

      \ Dr. Sanjay Jain: \r\nHi Ellen\r\nSorry for the delay,  I found your email\
      \ in my spam.  Yes this is a tricky one and probably have folks on both sides\
      \ of the aisle.  The definition in Uberon states it is part of medulla https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/uberon/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FUBERON_0001284&viewMode=PreferredRoots&siblings=false\
      \ while the anatomical tree is showing as part of cortex because it is extension\
      \ of outer cortex diving deep into the kidney all the way to the pelvis.  Histologically,\
      \ this is pretty similar to cortical tissue so many for that reason may call\
      \ it cortex.  But traditionally we mark the kidney in 2 regions, cortex (outer)\
      \ and medulla (inner part).  So anatomically this would be in the inner part\
      \ between the medullary pyramids.  But then we have interlobar vessels that\
      \ run between the medullary pyramid and the renal columns so what should we\
      \ call them to be anatomically a part of.  And then Uberon defines renal medulla\
      \ to be synonymous with renal pyramids.  Most people talking about renal medulla\
      \ actually are really implying renal pyramids, and when talking about cortex,\
      \ it is the cortical arch that is being referred to.  So this comes to your\
      \ question, if we say cortex what cell types will we expect to see there, and\
      \ same for medulla.   So how do we reconcile these conflicting issues of regional\
      \ anatomy and histology and common usage.  It is sort of what we struggled with\
      \ separating renal corpuscle from glomerulus.  One could be more precise and\
      \ say cortical arch, medullary pyramid, renal column as anatomical references\
      \ in the human kidney.   Any way we can discuss what the ontologists suggest\
      \ for consistency and see if the community would buy in.\r\nThanks\r\nSanjay\

      \ reason may call it cortex. But traditionally we mark the kidney in\n> 2 regions,\

      \ One could be more precise and say cortical arch,\n> medullary pyramid, renal\

      \ The only options that come to my mind to reconcile two opposite views (renal\

      \ columns part of _kidney_ more broadly; add a comment to say that disagreements\
      \ in the community make it hard to pick a more granular location; (please don't\

    - "Hi @megbalk ,\r\n\r\n> How do I add a taxon constraint? It'd be helpful for\
      \ other things I'm doing as well.\r\n\r\nSure. You can add a \"never in taxon\"\
      \ constraint as an annotation property. In Protege, highlight the newly created\
      \ class 'rostrum', then click on the green \"+\" next to \"Annotations\", and\
      \ from the list select \"never in taxon\" (there are two, select the one in\
      \ bold). Then, in the text box (\"Literal\" tab), fill in 'Homo sapiens'. I'll\
      \ leave it to you please to check if 'rostrum' can be further restricted to\
      \ 'never in Euarchontoglires'.\r\nTo see examples of how and where 'never in\
      \ taxon' is used in Uberon, you may go to the \"Annotation property hierarchy\"\
      \ tab in Protege, select 'never in taxon' (the one in bold), and then click\
      \ on the tab \"Annotation Property Usage\" in the window where one usually looks\
      \ at a term's details. E.g., 'cervical rib' is restricted to 'Homo sapiens'.\
      \   \r\nSummary documentation on taxon constraints is [here](https://obofoundry.github.io/obo-patterns.github.io/key-topics/taxon_constraints/).\r\

    issue_comments:
    - Hi, who could I ask for feedback on a term that came from ZFA/teleost curators,
      please? Thanks.
    - Maybe @ybradford could help.
    - This issue has not seen any activity in the past 6 months; it will be closed
      automatically in one year from now if no action is taken.
    - "@sabrinatoro do you have any expertise in this area? Or do you know someone\
      \ from ZFIN that could potentially help? thanks!\r\n"
    - '@nicolevasilevsky @paolaroncaglia I can help. I might not be able to take action
      today but will make sure it gets changed. The suggested change seems reasonable. '
    - "@nicolevasilevsky and @paolaroncaglia \r\nWhen  \"DEL\" is mainly used in zebrafish\
      \ publication, everyone knows (or should know) what DEL refers to. \r\n\r\n\
      I took a look at the terms for the other blastomere layers. The labels are:\
      \ \r\n- 'yolk syncytial layer' (synonym: YSL) in ZFA --> corresponds to UBERON:\
      \ 'yolk syncytial layer'\r\n- 'EVL' (synonym: enveloping layer) in ZFA --> corresponds\
      \ to UBERON: 'enveloping layer of ectoderm'\r\n\r\nTherefore I think it would\
      \ be ok to update the label of 'DEL' in UBERON to 'deep cell layer', and add\
      \ 'DEL' as an exact synonym. \r\n\r\n\r\nWRT adding \"gastrulation\" in the\
      \ label : \r\nfrom a zebrafish community perspective, there will never be any\
      \ confusion about what the \"deep cell layer\" means. If one needs to talk about\
      \ the cell layer that is deep in a specific tissue, they would not use \"deep\
      \ cell layer\". \r\nHowever, I appreciate that UBERON would be used by a broader\
      \ community than the zebrafish community. And therefore I think adding \"gastrulation\"\
      \ would be fine. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you need me to make these changes\
      \ in the ontology. I would be happy to. \r\n\r\n"
    - "Thanks @ybradford and @sabrinatoro. \r\n@sabrinatoro please go ahead and make\
      \ the edits, thanks!"
    - '@ybradford @sabrinatoro thank you both! Yes, ideally we''d want to make the
      labels as unambiguous as possible. Also, for synonyms that are actually abbreviation/acronyms,
      you could add an annotation property has_synonym_type = abbreviation. My personal
      preference would be for DEL not to be an exact synonym, but rather broad or
      related, because it''s potentially not unambiguous in the broader non-zebrafish
      community (short acronyms rarely are). Thank you! '

      \n\r\nThese should instead be under 'surface of bone'.  It may also be useful\
      \ to have more grouping classes for types of surface of bone (e.g. groove).\
      \  \r\n\r\nThere is a more general issue here with whether bone substructures\
      \ are defined as surfaces, anatomical spaces (see sulcus terms) or 3D parts\
      \ of bone (see condyle).  Fixing this would be outside of the scope of this\
      \ ticket, but might make a good mini project for patternization, if we have\
      \ strong use cases."
    issue_comments:
    - This issue has not seen any activity in the past 6 months; it will be closed
      automatically in one year from now if no action is taken.
    - HI @megbalk - would you be happy to have a go at changing this ? Changing classifications
      for bone specific structure(s) to 'surface of bone' ?
    - "@dosumis I can do that. Perhaps we can add the broader issue to discuss at\
      \ the UBRON meetings?\r\n"
    - I am unsure what "nuchal groove" is, but emailed people that study amphibians.
    - ok, made a pull request. Only found a couple of terms that were bones.

    - '@cmungall are we going to discuss this at the next meeting? Maybe we could
      discuss midlines too?'
    - Look at uberon 2x terms that are under anatomical line and see which are actually
      lines and which arent

    - I will create a branch and add this term. I suspect this term also needs taxon

    - "Hi @megbalk ,\r\n\r\n> @paolaroncaglia does this need a taxon constraint too?\r\
      \n\r\nGood point; when creating new terms, it's always useful to consider that.\
      \ You don't provide references or usage examples, and I'm not sure what species\
      \ have an 'antorbital notch'. However, it may be that the _parent_ terms you\
      \ suggest already have the appropriate taxon constraints. In this case, the\
      \ new term would inherit the taxon rule \"only in Vertebrata\" via 'bone fossa'\
      \ and its ancestor(s), plus it would inherit the broader 'only in Craniata'\
      \ via 'skull' (you can see all this in Protege). If 'antorbital notch' occurs\
      \ in some vertebrates but not others, it'd be useful if you could add more stringent\
      \ constraints. \r\nAlso, in general, please consider adding definition database\
      \ cross references  (papers, books, reliable internet resources...).\r\nThanks!\r\
      \nPaola"
    - "@megbalk \r\nJust a note to say that details of how to formalize taxon constraints\
      \ are currently under discussion (there's a whole GitBub project board [here](https://github.com/orgs/obophenotype/projects/2#card-58876023)).\
      \ In particular, 'only in taxon' is being considered for obsoletion, possibly\
      \ in favor of 'in taxon', but I wasn't involved in the most recent discussion.\
      \ So perhaps best to make a note in your tickets of what taxonomic groups the\
      \ new term a) would never apply to, and/or b) is (only?) found in, and come\
      \ back to apply those rules when a resolution is reached? I'll make a note in\
      \ the agenda for the next CL/Uberon editors' meeting."

    - '@paolaroncaglia this wont be a quick fix i think, but i think the bigger problem
      is the comment you linked needs an uberon release. Is the term fixed in uberon
      already? Cause if it is, once uberon is released, can try to fix it without
      the need to fully untangle the above. '
    - '@shawntanzk thanks for your prompt reply. The thing is, the CL term that originated
      the discussion was created quite some time ago, and the relevant Uberon edits
      were made quite some time ago, and both CL and Uberon had been released at least
      once since; in fact I remember with a fair degree of certainty that the anatomy
      changes had even percolated to Mondo and EFO. Then something happened, please
      see conversation between David and myself below the comment I linked to.'

      \n\r\n1) delete axioms from imports that are causing the error in uberon (this\
      \ I need your help with cause I can't follow the thread attached, but I assume\
      \ the cyclical issue is that an import is cyclically importing something that\
      \ you want out)\r\n2) Make and uberon release with IMP=false \r\n3) Refresh\
      \ CL import of uberon and make sure the unwanted axiom isn't there, if not remove\
      \ it\r\n4) make a CL release\r\n5) refresh the uberon import of CL\r\n\r\n@matentzn\
      \ the above should fix an issue with cyclical errors right? or am I missing\

    - '@shawntanzk thanks. I won''t touch anything for now, but will be happy to help
      if I can once we have confirmation of the best procedure.'
    - 'I''ve been scared of hitting this problem for years.  Zombie axioms are an
      inevitable result of circular import dependencies + imports pulling imported
      content. I think it might become a regular occurrence now we''re doing lots
      of interdependent edits. Base files are the obvious solution (no imports of
      imports).  As I understand it, the problem is that this => incomplete imports
      (we don''t get all dependencies of dependencies) unless we import everything
      from one huge merged ontology.  But maybe slightly incomplete is fine?  '
    - My favourite problem. Given the huge amount of memory Uberon requires anyways,
      it would be a good candidate to try the base-merge-extract-prune workflow. To
      get this done I need a developer like @anitacaron or @hkir-dev for ~5 days straight,
      it can be done.

      \ [CL:0000066] is \u201Cexact\u201D). By contrast, \u201Cdebatable mappings\u201D\
      \ are between terms whose equivalence is not as clear-cut and may be argued\
      \ in favour or against (e.g., it is debatable whether FBbt\u2019s `subperineurial\
      \ glial sheath` [FBbt:00007091] should be mapped to Uberon\u2019s `glial blood\

      \ it could be a stretch to state that the two are _equivalent_). \u201CDebatable\
      \ mappings\u201D would probably be best represented using SSSOM, which would\
      \ allow for more \u201Cnuanced\u201D mappings.\r\n\r\n3) FBbt would provide\
      \ the \u201Cexact mappings\u201D as a supplementary TSV file containing simple\

    issue_comments:
    - This is great. I would supply any and old mappings as SSSOM, no matter how trivial.
      Future generations need to understand what they mean..
    - "This all makes sense, but I note you are bundling two pretty big changes\r\n\
      together.\r\n\r\nThe issue of SOT for pairwise is a complex one and many technical\
      \ and\r\nsocial factors dictate which side the SOT lies on. A major factor is\r\
      \nwhich side is likely to generate churn. If we need to make a lot of changes\r\
      \nto uberon to make it work better for arthropods then it will be a bit more\r\
      \ncomplex to coordinate changes. It might be an idea to do a first pass of\r\
      \nmany of these issues on the uberon side first, refresh mappings, then hand\r\
      \nover the baton. The 6x terms are a complicating factor here. Many are\r\n\
      pseudo-generalizations. Some are used for GO which has pseudo-general Dmel\r\
      \ndevelopment terms. Should we obsolete a bunch of these to make maintenance\r\
      \neasier? Or should we keep them around as a starting point for true\r\narthropod/insect\
      \ generalizations?\r\n\r\nThere are different considerations for CL and Uberon\
      \ (CL typically has more\r\ntrue generalizations outside vertebrata), and each\
      \ external AO has its own\r\ncharacteristics. I think transference of mapping\
      \ SOT entails a commitment\r\nto \"deep\" curation of the mappings, eg a holistic\
      \ view that doesn't just\r\nlook at labels but looks at the entailed OWL models,\
      \ the underlying paterns\r\nand the context of the term. This is not an easy\
      \ task, and in many ways\r\ncentralizing this under the control of the species-neutral\
      \ team makes\r\nthings easier IMO.\r\n\r\nUltimately you both are best placed\
      \ to make the final decision as to when\r\nand how to coordinate transference\
      \ of the SOT for FBbt, so proceed as\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAs to the other point,\
      \ yes we definitely need to indicate equiv vs\r\nnon-equiv mappings. The *intent*\
      \ is that all xrefs are true species\r\nequivalents and that we work through\
      \ the hard issues like the BBB. However, if we do\r\nwant to start curating\
      \ non-equiv mappings we should coordinate with Jim\r\n(GO) and Nico (Mondo)\
      \ on best practice for maintaining these (skos\r\nannotation on the xref?) and\
      \ pipeline transforms (separated owl axioms and\r\nskos annotations)\r\n\r\n\
      >\r\n"
    - '@gouttegd Can we put this on the board for next Monday for @shawntanzk to prioritise? '
    - "@cmungall I don\u2019t think the coordination problem between Uberon/CL and\
      \ FBbt would be make more or less difficult depending on which side is maintaining\
      \ the mappings. The main factor would rather be the presence of an editor working\
      \ on both Uberon/CL and FBbt and aware of the need for coordination, which is\
      \ why I\u2019m here.\r\n\r\nRegarding the changes that would be needed in Uberon\
      \ (e.g. mass obsoletion of the pseudo-generalised terms), I believe @dosumis\
      \ was in favour of removing many of the insect terms to only keep those at the\
      \ \u201Chighest levels\u201C \u2013 those are the ones that would be mapped\
      \ to FBbt, so that we can say to Uberon consumers \u201Cif you\u2019re looking\
      \ for more precise terms for this insect structure, go look at the hierarchy\
      \ under the corresponding term in FBbt\u201D.\r\n\r\nIn any case I am not suggesting\
      \ to tackle this kind of changes in this issue. The idea here is rather to simply\
      \ change the way the mappings are maintained, without (for now) changing the\
      \ mappings themselves.\r\n\r\nSo in this first step, the \u201Cnew\u201D mappings\
      \ maintained on the FBbt side would be exactly the same as the ones we currently\
      \ have (including the absence of distinction between \u201Cequivalent\u201D\
      \ and \u201Cnon-equivalent\u201D mappings). Once the list of mappings is on\
      \ the FBbt side and the Uberon/CL pipeline is updated to make use of them, then\
      \ I would start going through the mappings, removing those that are bogus, differentiating\
      \ between the \u201Cequivalent\u201D and \u201Cnon-equivalent\u201D ones, etc.\r\
      \n\r\nAfter that, if/when we do some drastic changes in the way Uberon deals\
      \ with insect terms, I\u2019ll be aware of it (most likely I will be directly\
      \ involved!), and I can make sure those changes are reflected ASAP in the FBbt-maintained\
      \ mappings.\r\n\r\nOverall, I would like to get the mostly technical question\
      \ of \u201Chow do we maintain the mappings\u201D out of the way before tackling\
      \ the question of \u201Cwhat those mappings should be\u201D.\r\n\r\nI hope this\
      \ still makes sense.\r\n\r\n@matentzn I\u2019d certainly welcome the help of\
      \ the technical board to update the Uberon/CL pipeline! As for the priority,\
      \ it\u2019s up for the board itself to decide. I personally would like to have\
      \ that done as soon as possible, but if there are more important tasks ahead,\
      \ that\u2019s fine."

- id: pr2132
  pr_body: "This PR implements the proposal in #2116 according to the discussion in\
    \ the October 25th meeting of the Technical Board.\r\n\r\nRoughly, this PR:\r\n\
    \r\n1. Removes all cross-references to FBbt terms from the UBERON edit file (the\
    \ same thing will also need to be done in CL, but of course this is another repository\
    \ so another PR).\r\n2. Uses the FBbt-provided SSSOM file to generate a small\
    \ OWL file containing cross-reference statement for all the exact mappings described\
    \ in that SSSOM file.\r\n3. Merges the OWL file produced at step 2 into the `$(TMPDIR)/seed.obo`\
    \ file.\r\n\r\nFrom step 3, we are back to the pre-existing pipeline for generating\
    \ the bridge files: the `$(TMPDIR)/seed.obo` file still contains the FBbt xrefs\
    \ (they have been added back at step 3), so the `make-bridge-ontologies-from-xrefs.pl`\
    \ script can extract them and produce the bridge files.\r\n\r\nA few things to\
    \ note and discuss either here or at the next meeting of the Technical Board:\r\
    \n\r\na. For now, the FBbt SSSOM file is committed to the repository. This is\
    \ because we (FlyBase) have not done a FBbt release with the SSSOM file yet, so\
    \ that file is not available online for download. Once we have done that, we can\
    \ remove the SSSOM file from the UBERON repo and download it on the spot when\
    \ generating the bridges.\r\n\r\nb. With that pipeline, the cross-references are\
    \ _not_ part of the released ontology: they are only included in the `$(TMPDIR)/seed.obo`\
    \ file, which is only used to make the bridge files. If the intention is that\
    \ the cross-references _should_ be part of the released ontology, then the OWL\
    \ file generated in step 2 above should be made into a standard _component_, to\
    \ be imported as any other components (instead of a temporary file). @matentzn\
    \ Not sure what your intentions were on that point\r\n\r\nc. The process that\
    \ generates the bridge files from the cross-references (through the `make-bridge-ontologies-from-xrefs.pl`\
    \ script) is somewhat broken is in that all bridge axioms are generated into the\
    \ `uberon-bridge-to-fbbt` file, even the axioms about CL terms."

      \ the cross-reference being carried by the FBbt term and pointing toward the\
      \ CL term, as discussed in obophenotype/cell-ontology#1199). A custom logic\

      with parasypathetic cholinergic neuron projection bundle, because I think that
      there are very few cases of nerves that are purely cholinergic (though some
      branches might be). We have been working to develop clearer definitions for

  - done.
  - Added 'surface of bone'. Should I instead add a parent class 'articular surface
    for the tibia on the astragalus'?
  - done. did the same for ridge of medial condyle of talus.
  - how is this different from what I have? should these be subclass relationships?
  - done.
  - done.
  - "That would make sense - how well conserved is the function?\r\n\r\nGiven the\
    \ limited curation of articular surfaces into Uberon, we might want to discuss\

  - I think pretty well conserved. I'll add it.
  - done.
  - Typo. Conact -> Contact
  - fixed!
