    - This may need further discussion, as it is not immediately clear where to move
      the terms to - there is no 'increased cell number' term (yet). Perhaps just
      under 'increased object quality'? @dosumis ?

    - "I defer to what you think is best. I suggest the following, but it doesn't\
      \ translate well for non-animals:\r\n\r\n**'male with DSD'** or **'male, DSD'**\
      \ = an otherwise male individual of a non-hermaphroditic species who has ambiguous\
      \ or atypical congenital development of the reproductive system\r\n\r\n**'female\
      \ with DSD'** or **'female, DSD'** = an otherwise female individual of a non-hermaphroditic\
      \ species who has ambiguous or atypical congenital development of the reproductive\
      \ system\r\n\r\n**'intersex'** could serve as a synonym for both as it's still\
      \ in popular use, but may be considered offensive when applied to humans. DSD\
      \ can be expanded multiple ways to 'disorders/differences of sexual development/differentiation'.\r\
      \n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n-Edited because '...development of genetics, genitals,\

  - "1. It seems to me that `dendrite quality` should have `dendrite morphology` as\
    \ a subclass, since there are non-morphological qualities of dendrites, and all\
    \ morphological qualities of dendrites are qualities of dendrites. But perhaps\
    \ there is something I'm overlooking here. \r\n2. The definition (adapted from\
    \ ILX) doesn't seem correct to me. It basically states that dendrite morphology\
    \ inheres because of some density of dendritic spines. It is trivially true that\
    \ all dendrites have some density of dendritic spines (even aspiny dendrites have\
    \ a density of spines -- it's zero), so it's not false to assert this. However,\
    \ there are other structures, aside from dendritic spines, that are relevant here.\
    \ `tufted` and `varicose` (subclasses) are dendrite morphologies that do not inhere\
    \ in a neuron by virtue of the bearer's dendrite density, for example. \r\n\r\n\
    Perhaps: \"A morphological quality inhering in a neuron's dendrites by virtue\
    \ of the bearer's physical composition.\" This seems _very_ general, though, so\
    \ maybe some variation of this?  "
  - "I wonder if that's the reason why there seems to be entries that mean the same\
    \ thing but asserted differently? from comment in #55 \r\n\r\n> Sparsely spiny\
    \ dendrite quality and spiny low density seems to mean the same thing, here are\
    \ their respective ILX defs:\r\n> Sparsely spiny dendrite quality: 'Characterized\
    \ by a low density of dendritic spines.'\r\n> Spiny low density: 'Characterized\
    \ by a low density of spines on dendrites'\r\n> Same for Spiny high density and\
    \ Spiny dendrite quality.\r\n\r\nAlso agree with the second point, though I would\
    \ like to get some feedback from @tgbugs on this. \r\n\r\nI do think having dendrite\
    \ morphology and asserting `tufted` and `varicose` under that would be a good\
    \ idea."
  - "1. Yes. Dendrite quality could a number of things beyond morphology including\
    \ electrical properties of the dendrite membrane. I also currently have spiny\
    \ phenotype modelled as subClassOf dendrite phenotype not as subClassOf dendrite\
    \ morphological phenotype since in principle they should be treated as orthogonal.\r\
    \n2. Yes, that InterLex definition is ancient and incorrect. I would not limit\
    \ the definition to morphological properties as mentioned in 1.\r\n\r\nWith regard\
    \ to spine density, I use intersectionOf spiny and sparse like so (reusing PATO\
    \ and and a phenotype modifier property, though I have not fully worked out whether\
    \ the hasPhenotypeModifier approach works out as desired).\r\n\r\n```ttl\r\nowl:intersectionOf\

    \ owl:someValuesFrom PATO:0001609 ] )\r\n\r\n```"
  - "Thanks @tgbugs, will fix accordingly. \r\nOn the spine density, am I right to\
    \ say that you would suggest removing `spiny high density` and `spiny low density`\
    \ and just leaving 'spiny dendrite quality' that could be modified accordingly? "
  - Yes. My suggestion would be to have spiny as a quality which would imply that
    there is at least one spine, use complement of for aspiny (zero spines), and then
    use other pato qualities to provide addition information about what "more than
    one" means. The reason for this is that there are many different possible ways
    to quantify spinyness and creating an individual quality for each of them is likely
    to be a pain down the line.
  - I thought that we were going to make dendrite quality broader than morphology?
  - 'ah sorry, misunderstood, yeah happy to move it up to quality '
  - 'actually would it make more sense to be asserted as a ''physical object quality''(PATO:0070036)? '
  - 'I think that `physical object quality` is for monadic qualities only. If we want
    to include non-monadic (relational) qualities at some time, then it should be
    under `quality`. '

    comments:
    - I don't think these labels should include "(plant)". These terms are only used
      in plants, which is clear from the definition, so no need to clarify the label.
      I will make the change. Also updating the wording of the definition slightly.
    - To clarify the animal definition of diandrous and monandrous (which I think
      are rarely used, if ever), I suggest instead using the more common terms protandrous
      and protogynous. These are generally qualities of an organism, so I will move
      them to be subclasses of phenotypic sex, rather than mixed sex, so they can
      inhere in either an organism or a population or species.
    - I will also add a term for sequential hermaphrodite (subclass of hermaphrodite)
      that will be a parent of these terms.
    - I deleted the diandrous and monandrous terms created by @nicolevasilevsky and
      added new terms for protogynous and protandrous. @diatomsRcool, if you still
      need terms for populations with two types of males or one type of male for EOL,
      let me know.

      \ Thoughts on this @tgbugs? "
    - I think we should included an editor note or similar to explain exactly why
      we need this due to the confusing nature of the original nomenclature where
      there is a cell type that has the same name as a dendrite type but the cell
      type with the name is a specific subset of the cells with the dendrite type.
    - "> Bipolar can't be under here - that applies to cells with axon & dendrite\
      \ emerging from opposite ends of the soma.\r\n\r\n@tgbugs wondered what your\
      \ thoughts on this are - currently bipolar is asserted under cell with bitufted\
      \ dendrite morphology, however @dosumis makes a good point that bipolar cells\
      \ have one end being axons, while the other being dendrite, hence not technically\
      \ falling under cell with bitufted dendrite morphology."
    - "There is some confusion here. When I check the Petilla paper (which is what\
      \ the NPO terms correspond most closely to) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2868386/\
      \ I see this in the dendrites section:\r\n\r\n> The polarity of the dendritic\
      \ arborization16 can be described (FIG. 1a\u2013h; Supplementary information\

      \ cells have one, two or multiple long primary dendrites, respectively, extending\
      \ from their cell body17,18. \u2018Bitufted\u2019 cells have two clusters of\
      \ branches that originate directly from the soma and extend in opposite directions19.\
      \ In any interneuron with bidirectional dendrites (be it bipolar or bitufted),\

  - My reading was that they originate on opposite sides of the soma, because you
    could imagine two primary dendrites that originate on the same pole and then extend
    in opposite directions.

    - "The term _branches_ can be used to describe both (parts of) axons and dendrites,\
      \ although it's often disambiguated through context (in my experience). In [1078](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/pull/1078),\
      \ basket cells have branched axons, and bitufted cells have branched dendrites\
      \ (in the original definition). \r\n\r\nMaybe _bitufted cell morphology_ should\
      \ be general so that it is agnostic between dendritic and axonal branching.\
      \ I think @tgbugs would have some good advice. "
    - "Unqualified uses of the term `branches` are ambiguous and should be avoided\
      \ or should be qualified for clarity. For bitufted cells I would go with this\
      \ paragraph from the 2004 paper https://doi.org/10.1038/nrn1519\r\n\r\n> Bitufted\
      \ cells. Bitufted cells (BTCs) are similar to BPCs and DBCs in that they usually\
      \ have ovoid somata and give rise to primary dendrites from opposite poles to\
      \ form a bitufted morphology (Fig. 1). However, unlike the narrow vertical axonal\
      \ projection of BPCs, and the 'horse-tail' axonal cluster of DBCs, BTC axons\
      \ have wider horizontal axonal spans, even across a cortical column (see online\
      \ supplementary information S1 (table)). The vertical projection is also less\
      \ extensive and crosses mostly to neighboring layers. BTCs are dendritic-targeting\
      \ cells14 that are found in layers II\u2013VI. They can express CB, CR, NPY,\
      \ VIP, SOM and CCK, but not PV (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\nNote that bipolar cells and\
      \ double boquet cells are also described as having bitufted _dendrites_, so\
      \ there is also a dendritic morphological phenotype that is bitufted which is\
      \ distinct from the neuron morphological phenotype bitufted (sigh). The point\
      \ is that they can't really be distinguished by their dendrite morphology alone,\
      \ axonal projection patterns etc. are required, so those bits should probably\
      \ be in the definition.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether defining bitufted cells\
      \ as cells with bitufted dendrites that don't fall into other categories makes\
      \ sense though. These issues were why why came up with the evidence based models\
      \ so that people could classify their cells as they wanted and report the data\
      \ to us without needing to have the model exactly correct. The end result though\
      \ is that absent an expert curator the descriptions are hard to understand and\
      \ apply\r\n"
    - "Thanks heaps @patrick-lloyd-ray & @tgbugs - really useful comments. \r\nI remember\
      \ having similar problems, and having to discuss this with @dosumis heaps.\r\
      \nI think that the current def which is taken mostly from the Petilla terminology\
      \ paper is useful in that it's very simple - in that regard I kept some of the\
      \ old def. \r\nBut reading what @tgbugs, I do think there needs to be a better\
      \ def with more details to distinguish them from bipolar and double boquet,\
      \ and the description in the Markram paper does that better.\r\nI've hence tried\
      \ to combine them a little - keeping the first sentence relatively simple and\
      \ (hopefully) clear while adding more in the gloss. (see #414)"
    - "> bipolar cells and double boquet cells are also described as having bitufted\
      \ dendrites, so there is also a dendritic morphological phenotype that is bitufted\
      \ which is distinct from the neuron morphological phenotype bitufted (sigh).\
      \ The point is that they can't really be distinguished by their dendrite morphology\
      \ alone, axonal projection patterns etc. are required\r\n\r\nThis is a really\
      \ interesting point. It seems to me that (ideally) bitufted cell morphology\
      \ would inhere in a cell _in virtue of_ bitufted dendrite morphology or bitufted\
      \ axon morphology (or both). It is an issue of grounding, IMO. This way, bitufted\
      \ cell morphology would then be distinct from bitufted dendrite morphology and\
      \ bitufted axon morphology, although one would be able to infer that bitufted\

      \ if this strategy makes perfect sense to us. It reminds me of ordering a drink\
      \ at certain places where the name of a size is not typically descriptive (e.g.,\
      \ a \"small\" drink can sometimes be very large); and this is just a case where\
      \ the name of a class is not descriptive of the morphology, which happens quite\
      \ often. \r\n\r\nAt any rate, the solution you propose @shawntanzk seems fine\
      \ to me. "
    - "Bitufted axon morphology doesn't really exist in that bitufteness isn't a property\
      \ of the axons alone in the way it is of the dendrites alone. As you note, while\
      \ it would be nice to have bitufted cell morphology derived from having bitufted\
      \ dendrite morphology the way that the term is used precludes this. We could\
      \ create a new class which is `cell with bitufted dendrite morphology` but it\
      \ will not match `bitufted cell` but at least it would help clarify the issue\
      \ and make it clear that `bitufted cell morphology` is a piece of inconsistent\
      \ historical terminology.\r\n\r\nI think this is similar to the pyramidal cell\
      \ morphology issue that we discussed before."
    - 'I can add in CL `cell with bitufted dendrite morphology` of which `bipolar
      cell` `bitfuted cell` `double bouquet cell` are subclass_of and use the def
      to clarify the issue a bit? I''m not sure if this should be in PATO though,
      I think it will be incredibly confusing unless we do it separately as dendrite
      morphology which comes with a whole host of other difficulties. Thoughts? '
    - "That's a good point @tgbugs . I'm happy with whatever solution captures existing\
      \ usage even if that means that it is not as systematic as we wish it were.\
      \ \r\n\r\n`bitufted cell morphology` is not so confusing as to deserve exclusion,\
      \ so I'm okay with the original solution @shawntanzk has given. \r\n\r\nI don't\
      \ think this is the last we have seen of this problem, so maybe we can discuss\
      \ a general solution/strategy at one of our meetings. "
    - I'm ok with the solution as given for now, the bitufted cell morphology is used
      and should be in PATO (precisely because it is well defined and the naming is
      confusing). I also think that `cell with bitufted dendrite morphology` might
      help.
    - '@tgbugs totally get where youre coming from, will create a ticket for ''cell
      with bitufted dendrite morphology'' :) '

    comments:
    - '@dosumis I would appreciate a review of the modelling here, because on review
      I think that the way I did this originally is not entirely correct, it conflates
      standard pyramidal morphology with the superclass of the other types, in that
      it is usually entirely possible to know that a pyramidal neuron is emphatically
      not a horizontal pyramidal neuron, however as defined right now this is not
      possible. I think we might need to shuffle labels and add a class for NormalPyramidalPhenotype
      or something like that.'
    - '@tgbugs Not following.  Does this def conflict with that for horizontal pyramidal
      neurons?  Perhaps in regard to how apical/basal are determined?'
    - I think the issue is that colloquially `pyramidal neuron` -> `vertical pyramidal
      phenotype` so if someone just reports `pyramidal phenotype` unqualified then
      they mean `vertical pyramidal phenotype`. As a result I never created `vertical
      pyramidal phenotype` because no one ever talks about it that way or would know
      what it means. We wind up in a situation where ideally the labels would be `pyramidal
      family morphological phenotype` or something like that (introducing yet another
      grouping term such as `family` seems like a bad idea here though), and then
      there would be `pyramidal morphological phenotype` as a subclass of that and
      disjoint with `horizontal pyramidal morphological phenotype`. Does this make
      sense?
    - 'That makes sense, I think your suggestion on having pyramidal family with standard/vertical
      pyramidal under it sounds like a good solution. I do worry that it might be
      confusing if we put it as just pyramidal morphology though - perhaps "standard
      pyramidal morphology" with "vertical pyramidal morphology" as a synonym and
      description clearly stating the verticality + as you suggest, disjoint with
      horizontal pyramidal morphology? '
    - I think that will work. I think that `pyramidal morphology` will need to be
      a synonym as well since it is by far the most common usage.
    - 'I''ve edited this term to be pyramidal family morphology, and have added standard
      pyramidal morphology accordingly - do let me know if you think the description
      is alright. Thanks! '

    - I think the difference is untufted have large radial distance, but either way,
      I've added "forming a star-like shape" to it to be clearer

    - From a provenance point of view, it might be worth noting that this particular
      morphological classification comes from the Markram lineage. Not sure how such
      things are tracked (we don't do it explicitly in NPO right now).
    - 'Happy to add it in an annotation, or a citation (I''m not familiar with Markram
      lineage)? thoughts @dosumis? '
    - '@tgbugs - can you suggest a reference that might make this clear, if the current
      one does no.'
    - The PMID listed in the definition is the best reference to use. The Markram
      lineage is the last author on the paper.

    comments:
    - I don't think these labels should include "(plant)". These terms are only used
      in plants, which is clear from the definition, so no need to clarify the label.
      I will make the change. Also updating the wording of the definition slightly.
    - To clarify the animal definition of diandrous and monandrous (which I think
      are rarely used, if ever), I suggest instead using the more common terms protandrous
      and protogynous. These are generally qualities of an organism, so I will move
      them to be subclasses of phenotypic sex, rather than mixed sex, so they can
      inhere in either an organism or a population or species.
    - I will also add a term for sequential hermaphrodite (subclass of hermaphrodite)
      that will be a parent of these terms.
    - I deleted the diandrous and monandrous terms created by @nicolevasilevsky and
      added new terms for protogynous and protandrous. @diatomsRcool, if you still
      need terms for populations with two types of males or one type of male for EOL,
      let me know.

    - that is what I was wondering too. But the def says existing or functioning as
      though broken... Is a fragmented bone considered broken, @pnrobinson? Thanks!

      \ another example of how we get ourselves in a tangle by not explicitly referring\

    - Please review why this term does not appear under 'parity' @nicolevasilevsky
      @zhengj2007
    - I have done a fresh release now so the term is available. Still would like to
      know!
    - "oh yeah, seems like it should be a child of parity and a parent of multiparous\
      \ and primiparous.\r\n\r\n@zhengj2007 do you agree?"
    - (I didn't mean to close this!)
    - 'According to the definition of the ''parity'', it refers to "The number of
      time that a viviparous organism has given birth.". It''s children are 0, 1,
      or multiple time(s) given birth. The ''parous'' is organism successfully reproduced.
      So, I don''t think it is the child of ''parity''. But I think its parent should
      be more specific. I am happy to add it as child of ''reproductive quality''.
      I will ask other VEuPathDB people to check which parent is more appropriate. '
    - thank you @zhengj2007!
    - "@nicolevasilevsky Here is one comment I got from VEuPathDB: \"I agree that\
      \ 'parous' should be inserted as a parent of 'multiparous' and 'primiparous'.\
      \ I also agree with you that there are some semantic issues with 'parity' being\
      \ the parent of 'parous'\".\r\nI'd like to leave the decision to you and PATO\
      \ developers for the parent of 'parous'.  \r\n\r\n"
    - I made parous a sibling of parity (under reproductive quality) and added multi
      and primiparous under parous.
    - '@matentzn @nicolevasilevsky Thanks for making the term available for us.'
    - "Since the parent of the term changes, is it better to update the definition\
      \ too?\r\nfrom \"An organismal quality of having successfully reproduced.\"\
      \ to \"A reproductive quality of having successfully reproduced.\"\r\n@matentzn\
      \ @nicolevasilevsky Thanks!"
    - I dont think that is necessary; the definition is necessary and sufficient.
      Or do you think it does not reflect the truth? It just creates an odd dependency
      if we one day decide to remove it again from reproductive quality for some reason..
      I think its better as is but correct me if I am wrong.

    - Only that such terms belong in GENO rather than in PATO, as they are genome
      features rather than phenotype/qualities. Do feel free to make requests in the
      GENO tracker.
    - "Hi Val  et al. \r\n(Chris from GigaScience here),\r\nPersonally I think ploidy\
      \ is a phenotype, its a physical chromosomal feature that can be seen/observed\
      \ with chromosome spreads in a microscope and its not a gene specific thing\
      \ like most genotypes. \r\nThe fact the PATO already has a large number of ploidy\
      \ terms defined would suggest that someone there has previously thought the\
      \ same way! To keep the ploidy ontology terms all together would seem appropriate\
      \ to me.\r\nIf all of the ploidy terms are going to be depreciated in favour\
      \ of being in GENO then there is no reason why this one cant be added now to\
      \ PATO and moved at the same time as the rest to GENO.\r\nCheers\r\nChris\r\n"
    - "\r\nYes I was thinking about this  more this morning!  I guess it is observable...\
      \ although ploidy doesn't seem to be referred to as a phenotype...so I don't\
      \ know if there is a special convention here. \r\n\r\nMelissa probably knows\
      \ better....\r\n\r\n"
    - 'Can we find out the history of the existing ploidy terms in PATO? Who added
      them? '
    - "heh, it may have been me ;-). I do think they should be ceded to GENO, which\
      \ did not exist back then. We do have somewhat of a fuzzy line to draw regarding\
      \ what constitutes a phenotypic quality once one gets to the molecular level.\
      \ I do think that given the basic premise of G+E=P, that generally we can consider\
      \ anything relating to genome attributes should not be in PATO but rather SO\
      \ or GENO, but this is just my opinion.\r\n\r\n@mbrush can you comment?"
    - "So given the ploidy stuff are already there in PATO can we get double haploid\
      \ added ASAP, then worry about moving them all over to GENO in the future? We'd\
      \ like to actually use the ontology term in a data entry now, otherwise it will\
      \ just go into our database as free text.\r\nThanks Chris."
    - "Hi all - my thoughts on 'ploidy' terms as qualities vs genotypes vs phenotypes.\r\
      \n\r\nIn PATO, the ploidy terms are framed as qualities that inhere in a genome\
      \ (or an organism by extension).  I think it is perfectly valid to consider\
      \ these as qualities, but this in my mind is different than being a phenotype.\
      \  Phenotypes are a particular type of quality that result from an interaction\
      \ between genetics and environment, and are typically qualities observed 'downstream'\
      \ of genetic sequence. Terms in PATO represent more general qualities that can\
      \ be used to compose a specific phenotype in a Phenotype ontology such as HP\
      \ or MP. For example, the phenotype 'cardiomegaly' (enlarged heart) is composed\
      \ of the PATO term 'increased size' inhering in the Uberon anatomical term 'heart'.\
      \ \r\n \r\nSo, I think it is fine to leave the existing ploidy terms in PATO\
      \ as qualities, and add 'double haploid' to the list.  W.r.t. whether such PATO\
      \ ploidy terms should be the basis of phenotype terms or genotype terms in other\
      \ ontologies (e.g. HPO or GENO), I lean toward the latter. For example, a 'double\
      \ haploid genome' class would represent a 'double haploid' quality inhering\
      \ in a genome - and such a class would belong in an ontology like GENO or SO,\
      \ not a phenotype ontology like HPO.  This is because I tend to make the G vs\
      \ P divide between things that represent the state of genetic sequence in a\
      \ cell (genotype), and observable states or features 'downstream' of such sequence\
      \ alterations (phenotype) - which can range from molecular changes in gene expression\
      \ or protein function, all the way through gross anatomical defects and behavioral\
      \ abnormalities.  But I do concede, to @only1chunts point, the notion of a double\
      \ haploid genotype is in a grey area between things that clearly fall into the\
      \ G camp (SNVs, insertions, deletions, translocations), and things that clearly\
      \ fall into the P camp (protein malfunction, gross anatomical defects, behavioral\
      \ anomalies).  From some perspectives, there may be a valid argument that an\
      \ observed double haploid genome could be considered a P.\r\n \r\nIn summary\
      \ (apologies for being long winded), I think it is fine to add 'double ploidy'\
      \ as a quality to PATO.  If this is sufficient for the use case motivating this\
      \ ticket, we can leave it at that.  If there are use cases that would benefit\
      \ from ploidy-based genome/genotype terms, we can add them easily and quickly\
      \ to GENO.  Just my 2c.\r\n"

  - body: "In PATO, PATO:0001334 ! diameter is_a PATO:0000122 ! length. This causes\
      \ undesirable inferences for fission yeast cell shape phenotypes in FYPO.\r\n\
      \r\nMore generally, it looks like PATO isn't internally consistent in how it\
      \ handles terms in the PATO:0001708 ! 1-D extent branch. \r\n\r\n1. The text\
      \ definition of length is so broad that I can't easily see the distinction between\
      \ it and its superclass 1-D extent.\r\n\r\n2.- The fact that PATO:0000122, PATO:0000119\
      \ ! height; PATO:0000915 ! thickness, PATO:0000921 ! width, and PATO:0001595\
      \ ! depth are all separate (siblings under PATO:0001708) seems inconsistent\
      \ with the breadth of the PATO:0000122 text definition. \r\n\r\n3. Between issues\
      \ 1 and 2, it's as though a broader and a narrower sense of \"length\" are being\
      \ conflated - the broader corresponding to the text def, and the narrower as\
      \ in length as opposed to width or depth.\r\n\r\n4. It's also a tiny bit confusing\
      \ that there are five terms for measurements that each correspond to one of\
      \ three possible dimensions in space but that's a smaller problem than the others.\r\
      \n\r\n5. PATO:0001711 ! perimeter is also is_a PATO:0000122, but its definition\
      \ doesn't really fit the text definition of length. A perimeter isn't a distance\
      \ between two separate points; it's the distance travelled going around a 2-D\
      \ shape from one point back to the starting point.\r\n\r\n**tl;dr:** It would\
      \ help us immensely if PATO:0001334 ! diameter and PATO:0001711 ! perimeter\
      \ could be moved to is_a PATO:0001708 ! 1-D extent. That's the minimal change\
      \ to relieve us of dodgy inferences.\r\n\r\nAdditional changes to text definitions\
      \ would help clarify distinctions among the various subclasses of PATO:0001708\
      \ ! 1-D extent, but aren't so urgent.\r\n"

    - Great to see this change, Thanks!
    - can;t they apply to cells?
    - Cells are either an organism themselves, or part of an organism, so the def'n
      fits, Right?
    - "the original idea was that organisms is at the organism level\n\nif it pertains\
      \ to parts of organisms then biomolecular and cellular \nqualities are organismal\

    - "Continuing this theme, `quality of a suspension` was requested over at https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/484\r\
      \n\r\nThis has consequences for the label of:\r\n>quality of a colloidal suspension\r\
      \n\r\nThere's some semantic fuzziness here, but generally [suspensions are not\
      \ like colloids in that they will eventually settle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)).\r\
      \n\r\nThus, we propose:\r\n* the label of `quality of a colloidal suspension`\
      \ be changed to `quality of a colloid` and the def updated to: \r\n  * A physical\
      \ quality inhering in an entity by virtue of a portion of the bearer's molecular\
      \ or polymolecular constituents present in one phase being dispersed in a portion\
      \ of the bearer's constituents present in another phase. (xref [IUPAC Gold Book](https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/C/C01172.html))\r\
      \n* a class for `quality of a suspension` be created with the def: \r\n  * A\
      \ physical quality inhering in an entity by virtue of the bearer's solid or\
      \ liquid constituents being transiently dispersed in a solid, liquid, or gas\
      \ before settling due to gravity or centrifugal forces.\r\n\r\nFor suspension,\
      \ note that [IUPAC definitions](https://goldbook.iupac.org/html/S/S06198.html)\
      \ speak only of solid dispersed in liquid, however many alternate usages seem\
      \ to exist. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
