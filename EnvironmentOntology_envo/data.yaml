  - The placement may not always be artificial, but should be okay for now.
  - I don't see the axiom about being the output of a human-led construction process
    - that would allow it to be reasoned under the respective branch.
  - An axiom that links this to ENVO:clay would be handy, but not a necessity

      \ - do the grains exist?\r\n\r\n> In order to capture how rock materials are\
      \ described, GSO has a Rock_Grain_Material class \"A Rock_Material constituent\
      \ consisting of particles that share a set of characteristics, e.g. genesis,\
      \ particle size (distribution), mineralogy, shape.\" One approach to describing\
      \ a rock material is in terms of proportions of various Rock_Grain_Material\
      \ instances. For instance a sand deposit might consist of 90% [well rounded\
      \ quartz grains 0.2 to 0.7 mm in diameter], and 10% [subangular feldspar grains\
      \ 0.2 to 0.5 mm in diameter]. The brackets are Rock_Grain_Material instances.\
      \ Here's an [example rock description](https://github.com/Loop3D/GKM/blob/master/Loop3D-GSO/Examples/GSO-ExampleRockMaterialBolsaQuartzite.ttl)\
      \ using this approach.\r\n\r\nMany thanks - I think we can map ENVO classes\
      \ to this more specialised resource in an SSSOM / harmonisation activity. Perhaps\
      \ via ESIP."
    - "> At high levels of consolidation - do the grains exist?\r\n\r\nIn general\
      \ that is how rocks are described, e.g. a metamorphic rock, strongly consolidated\
      \ (indurated), consists of 30% muscovite in 2-3 mm diameter flakes aligned in\
      \ a schistose fabric; 15% equant almandine garnet 1-2 mm; 40% anhedral quartz\
      \ grains 1-4 mm diameter, some with oblate shapes aligned in the schistosity;\
      \ 15 % plagioclase (An 20-30) in subhedral 1-2 mm grains. \r\nThe fundamental\
      \ nature of a rock or sediment is its particulate constitution. Of course, being\
      \ the Earth, there are edge cases that are interesting -- volcanic glass, aphanitic\
      \ materials, monomineralic rocks.    \r\n\r\nI've looked at ENVO several times\
      \ thinking about how it might be better harmonized with GSO/GeoSciML, but always\
      \ come away concluding that its a BIG job that would be really interesting,\
      \ but needs some resourcing!"
    - "> Because the size classifications vary by discipline and region, I'm moving\
      \ much of those statements to comments rather than using them as differentia.\
      \ \r\n\r\nThere are quite a few things whose definitions vary regionally. You\
      \ may recall that my initial intervention on soil orders was because the ENVO\
      \ orders are actually local to USA. \r\n\r\nIf ENVO is intended to be international,\

      \ so they can move onto their longer list. "
    - Yes, I'm helping out a bit, but Barry is the lead on the submissions to ENVO!
    - "I'm considering a revised definition for \"conveyor system\":\r\nA system which\
      \ is composed of one or more machines that when activated continuously transports\
      \ material available at one location to another.\r\nI was uncertain if this\
      \ use of system is appropriate? The other choice is to say a conveyor system\
      \ is a \"manufactured material\"?"
    - "@BarryFen unless you are using a cardinality constraint (e.g, `'has component'\
      \ min 2`) you should probably use `has part`.  \r\n\r\nAFIK, [has component](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002180)\
      \ is intended to be used when you need to use cardinality constraint with a\
      \ parthood relation. If you try to use a cardinality constraint with `has part`,\
      \ it will cause an error. OWL does not permit cardinality constraints to be\
      \ used with transitive properties.\r\n\r\nSee #1072 if you want more details."
    - "I'm thinking yes and no!  \r\n**Yes** in that has part is transitive, so if\
      \ some piece of a conveyor belt mechanism has a motor in it, then we can say\
      \ conveyor system has motor too, by transitivity.  [edit] And chances are a\
      \ modern conveyor belt may have more than one motor in it, some actually move\
      \ conveyor belt endpoints around. So 'has part' is better because it allows\
      \ one or more motors to be inside or connected to some component of the conveyor\
      \ system.\r\n**BUT** \"'has component' some\" ... translates to cardinality\
      \ expression \"'has component' 1 or more\" , and that is fine for hermit as\
      \ well as elk.  Its only the transitive 'has part' relation that freaks out\
      \ hermit with cardinality constraints?"
    - "> Its only the transitive 'has part' relation that freaks out hermit with cardinality\
      \ constraints?  \r\n\r\nYes. DL doesn't permit cardinality constraints on transitive\
      \ object properties.\r\n\r\nAs for whether a cardinality constraint is needed,\
      \ you may find it helpful to read what @cmungall wrote [here](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2021/03/24/avoid-mixing-parthood-with-cardinality-constraints/).\
      \ \r\n\r\nThe expression `'has part' min 1` is equivalent to `'has part' some`\
      \ and Hermit will implicitly convert `'has part' min 1` to `'has part' some`.\
      \ I don't know if Elk does this, but I wouldn't be surprised if it does. Plus,\
      \ Elk will blissfully ignore DL violations like `'has part' min 5`. It will\
      \ raise an error when writing such expressions.\r\n\r\nAs for the question of\
      \ whether you should use `has part` or `has component`, I tend to use `has part`\
      \ unless I can think of a compelling counter example. Can you think of any queries\
      \ you might want to run in which you wouldn't want the transitivity inference\
      \ to hold?"
    - "Its going to take more work, and probably trial and error, but the overall\
      \ objective of the food equipment terms and their mereology / parthood is to\
      \ clearly define which pieces of equipment, or which parts of them, are the\
      \ origin of biosamples.  I'm thinking now to set aside the drive to be more\
      \ particular about component cardinality, at least in this round.  A piece of\
      \ equipment may have exactly 4 legs or 3 legs etc., but more importantly we'll\
      \ want ways to describe which leg a biosample came from.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity's\
      \ sake I'm going to move these two terms over to the list of 14 in https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/1282\
      \ and make a single pull request, so I think we can close this issue now, and\
      \ address any further definition work alongside the other terms."
    - "Looks like https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/pull/1295 was closed\
      \ but not merged, however, this seems to have been picked up with https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/1282,\
      \ for which the PR https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/pull/1298 has\
      \ been merged.\r\n\r\nBoth original terms requested in this issue here `conveyor\
      \ system` and `flume` are in the envo-edit file, just pending release. So I\

  - I am not enthused about adding more investigative processes to ENVO, there is
    no clear dividing line between ENVO and OBI here. But we can add contingent we
    may need to offload these later
  - We need that term has we need to record when the process happens. But maybe you
    can suggest a better way for handling time here.

    - "[soil layer](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_03600030) was previously added\r\
      \n\r\nRemaining 4 need to be added"
    - "1. A `soil horizon` is a sub-class of `soil layer`, which is formed by a consistent\
      \ genetic process **_or_** has a homogeneous composition - the [ASLS](https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/5230)\
      \ says \"with morphological properties different from layers below and above\
      \ it\". \r\n\r\nThe formal definition of [soil horizon](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_03600030)\
      \ (sub-class of `layer` with differentia 'composed primarily of some soil')\
      \ is actually OK for `soil layer`. However, the textual definition (\"A layer\
      \ which is parallel to the soil surface and which has roughly homogenous physical,\
      \ chemical and biological properties relative to the soil layers above or beneath\
      \ it. \") does better match `soil horizon`. Soil Layer is a more generic thing:\
      \ some soil-layers are defined purely as a depth range, so are not necessarily\
      \ homogeneous in their physical, chemical and biological properties. \r\n\r\n\
      2. New class required: Soil Contact - the interface between two horizons. A\
      \ soil-layer-top of a soil-horizon, which is also a soil-layer-bottom with respect\
      \ to an adjacent soil-horizon is called a `Contact`. \r\n\r\nOK @meganrwong\
      \ @ljgregory @abhritchie ?"
    - "Yes, this definition of `soil layer` suggests a horizon (horizons can be sub-typed,\
      \ e.g. NZ: `morphological horizon` and `functional horizon`). Our experience\
      \ is that `soil layer` is used to describe sampling artifacts whose extent is\
      \ dictated by the sampling strategy, not the characteristics of the soil. The\
      \ value of a `soil layer` class is debatable given ontologies like SOSA can\
      \ carry the necessary information.\r\n\r\nThe value of `soil layer top` and\
      \ `soil layer bottom` is unclear."
    - "Agree with the need for `soil contact`. Horizon boundaries have their own characteristics\
      \ (`shape`, `distinctness`).\r\n\r\nSuggest `soil horizon boundary` instead\
      \ of `soil contact`.\r\n\r\nContact implies the boundary between mappable soil\
      \ units. Also, soil scientists may also accuse us of Geology."

      \ slight soil compaction (was little to no...)\r\n-- slight soil compaction\r\

      \ and 'has quality' some condensed` where you'd get [condensed from PATO.](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/PATO_0001485)\r\
      \n\r\nAnother issue is that we can't represent \"no soil compaction\" so that\

      \ of the growing season. The occurrence of internal free water is very shallow\
      \ and persistent or permanent. Unless the soil is artificially drained, most\
      \ mesophytic crops cannot be grown. The soils are commonly level or depressed\
      \ and frequently ponded. If rainfall is high or nearly continuous, slope gradients\
      \ may be greater.\n"

    - "[soil layer](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_03600030) was previously added\r\
      \n\r\nRemaining 4 need to be added"
    - "1. A `soil horizon` is a sub-class of `soil layer`, which is formed by a consistent\
      \ genetic process **_or_** has a homogeneous composition - the [ASLS](https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/5230)\
      \ says \"with morphological properties different from layers below and above\
      \ it\". \r\n\r\nThe formal definition of [soil horizon](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_03600030)\
      \ (sub-class of `layer` with differentia 'composed primarily of some soil')\
      \ is actually OK for `soil layer`. However, the textual definition (\"A layer\
      \ which is parallel to the soil surface and which has roughly homogenous physical,\
      \ chemical and biological properties relative to the soil layers above or beneath\
      \ it. \") does better match `soil horizon`. Soil Layer is a more generic thing:\
      \ some soil-layers are defined purely as a depth range, so are not necessarily\
      \ homogeneous in their physical, chemical and biological properties. \r\n\r\n\
      2. New class required: Soil Contact - the interface between two horizons. A\
      \ soil-layer-top of a soil-horizon, which is also a soil-layer-bottom with respect\
      \ to an adjacent soil-horizon is called a `Contact`. \r\n\r\nOK @meganrwong\
      \ @ljgregory @abhritchie ?"
    - "Yes, this definition of `soil layer` suggests a horizon (horizons can be sub-typed,\
      \ e.g. NZ: `morphological horizon` and `functional horizon`). Our experience\
      \ is that `soil layer` is used to describe sampling artifacts whose extent is\
      \ dictated by the sampling strategy, not the characteristics of the soil. The\
      \ value of a `soil layer` class is debatable given ontologies like SOSA can\
      \ carry the necessary information.\r\n\r\nThe value of `soil layer top` and\
      \ `soil layer bottom` is unclear."
    - "Agree with the need for `soil contact`. Horizon boundaries have their own characteristics\
      \ (`shape`, `distinctness`).\r\n\r\nSuggest `soil horizon boundary` instead\
      \ of `soil contact`.\r\n\r\nContact implies the boundary between mappable soil\
      \ units. Also, soil scientists may also accuse us of Geology."

  - Thanks @KrishnaTO - this definition suggests that there's a "wind measuring process"
    superclass/genus - which I don't think is the case - could you explain the logic
    here?
  - The intent was, to describe a specialized term (wind run), used to describe the
    quantity (over a period of time, however much wind distance the instrument managed
    to read), and hint at its unnamed process which uses an anememeter, time and good
    ol' maths.
  - '''wind run'' is now under amount and the definition has been fixed to reflect
    that. I believe the PR can thus be merged'

      \n\r\n> When domain/range constraints are added, freezing fog is found to be\

      \ to first fix the incoherencies in ENVO. These are. like compilation errors\
      \ in programs, we just shouldn't be releasing the ontology with these in.\r\n\

    - "Earthquake is a tricky one. \r\n\r\nFrom an engineering viewpoint, an earthquake\
      \ is ground movement (vibration) at a location, as a result of various source\
      \ phenomena at a distance. The characteristic properties are time, amplitude,\
      \ acceleration etc at the observing location. \r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of\
      \ most geologists and geophysicists, the earthquake is the source phenomenon.\
      \ Usually underground fault-slippage or fracturing, but maybe cavity collapse,\
      \ an underground explosion, etc. The characteristic properties are location,\
      \ timing, focal-mechanism, moment, etc of the natural or artificial phenomenon\
      \ at the source. \r\n\r\nThese phenomena are causally related, but different,\
      \ though often given the same name. "
    - "Thanks @dr-shorthair. Yes we should make a separate ticket for earthquakes.\
      \ \r\n\r\nI guess the question now (as @wdduncan put it in #1072) is do we use\
      \ some simple object properties to replace OPs `has participant` in axioms `like\
      \ has participant min 2 techtonic plate`? Or do we keep those OPs and remove\
      \ the qualified cardinality restrictions (e.g. min 2) from the axiom and maybe\
      \ shove it into an AP on the axiom or similar?"
    - '@kaiiam - great idea to put the cardinality as an axiom annotations on a plain
      existential axiom using the existing object property. Would that be acceptable
      to you @pbuttigieg?'
    - "@cmungall are you referring to annotation approach I proposed [here](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/1072#issuecomment-906054179)?\r\
      \n\r\nWe would need to create a annotation (e.g., 'cardinality' or 'qualified\
      \ cardinality constraint') to capture this information. Do you prefer that instead\
      \ of creating a fake object property?"
    - '@wdduncan I was trying to recap what you [had suggested there](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/1072#issuecomment-906054179)
      so we can make a decision on it. @cmungall @pbuttigieg thoughts or preferences? '

      \ if there is a real use case for preserving some kind of linkage, then I suggest\
      \ thinking in terms of freezing fog forming the conditions for the formation\

      \ often lead to human error, if we go this route then we really need documented\
      \ design patterns for these structures.\r\n\r\nTo summarize\r\n\r\n 1. my preferred\

    - "Earthquake is a tricky one. \r\n\r\nFrom an engineering viewpoint, an earthquake\
      \ is ground movement (vibration) at a location, as a result of various source\
      \ phenomena at a distance. The characteristic properties are time, amplitude,\
      \ acceleration etc at the observing location. \r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of\
      \ most geologists and geophysicists, the earthquake is the source phenomenon.\
      \ Usually underground fault-slippage or fracturing, but maybe cavity collapse,\
      \ an underground explosion, etc. The characteristic properties are location,\
      \ timing, focal-mechanism, moment, etc of the natural or artificial phenomenon\
      \ at the source. \r\n\r\nThese phenomena are causally related, but different,\
      \ though often given the same name. "
    - "Thanks @dr-shorthair. Yes we should make a separate ticket for earthquakes.\
      \ \r\n\r\nI guess the question now (as @wdduncan put it in #1072) is do we use\
      \ some simple object properties to replace OPs `has participant` in axioms `like\
      \ has participant min 2 techtonic plate`? Or do we keep those OPs and remove\
      \ the qualified cardinality restrictions (e.g. min 2) from the axiom and maybe\
      \ shove it into an AP on the axiom or similar?"
    - '@kaiiam - great idea to put the cardinality as an axiom annotations on a plain
      existential axiom using the existing object property. Would that be acceptable
      to you @pbuttigieg?'

      \n\r\nWe would need to create a annotation (e.g., 'cardinality' or 'qualified\
      \ cardinality constraint') to capture this information. Do you prefer that instead\
      \ of creating a fake object property?"
    - '@wdduncan I was trying to recap what you [had suggested there](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/1072#issuecomment-906054179)

  - there are also saline evaporation ponds adjacent to salt lakes in continental
    areas, e.g. Great Salt Lake, Utah, or to evaporate saline water used to dissolve
    subsurface salt deposits e.g. around the Luke salt in the Phoenix area, Arizona.
  - "why complicate with 'groundwater' and 'heated by geothermal energy'.  simplify\
    \ to\r\n'a spring that emits water that is warmer than the ambient ground temperature'.\
    \   \r\nIs 'warm spring' a concept in ENVO.  Generally 'hot' connotes a temperature\
    \ above something like human body temperature."
  - ah, the joy of opaque identifiers. Can't evaluate this statement without resolving
    the URI...
  - circular.  a mountain range is a range.
  - "gramatically should use 'that' instead of 'which'\r\na cliff that is not adjacent...."
  - the original definition is much better.   To understand this revised definition,
    I have to figure out what you mean by 'beach' and what you mean by 'sea shore'....
  - use 'that'
  - hmmm, wouldn't features on the sea floor (sand waves, biogenic mounds, rift valleys,
    seamounts, reefs) also be considered undersea features?   these are not hydrographic.
  - I think 'a channel constructed by humans' is all you need.
  - "don't complicate with stuff that should be in notes.\r\n'A spring that emits\
    \ water containing a significant amount of dissolved minerals'.\r\nOf course a\
    \ purist might want to know what you mean by 'minerals' "
  - "why 'no longer'???\r\nA valley that does not contain perennial surface water."
  - what about dry valleys in deserts?
  - I'd suggest 'calcium-rich carbonate minerals'.   If its a 'coral' reef, don't
    the 'living organisms' have to be members of that genus?  Is there such a thing
    as a 'non-marine' reef??
  - "simplify\r\n' ... dissolution of soluble bedrock'"
  - a note indicating the connotation of karst association would be useful.
  - perhaps 'a shoreline landform...'   otherwise any cave would meet this definition.
  - I think marine terraces are located along the shore line of  a marine water body;
    many of them are subaerial, not submerged.
  - i assume 'large river' is defined in ENVO?  what does 'determined by a river'
    mean?
  - since the headwaters of a large river a likely to be small rivers, how is this
    different from a 'small river biome'?
  - seem like language like 'a biome hosted by the delta of a river'  would be better
    way to define.  Isn't a biome hosted by some environment?
  - Isn't the essential feature of a slope the fact that is has a surface elevation
    gradient greater than something like 5 degrees?  This definition would include
    flat terraces between a peak and a valley as slopes.
  - original definition is better.

    - This makes sense to me PATO elevation is a quality, ENVO elevation is a `solid
      astronomical body part` i.e. independent continuant. and RO `part of` requires
      the classes be of the same type. Hence the error.

      \ input (marine life), the definition suggests a differentia of the causal agent\
      \ (fishing gear). Consider a dog on a beach entangled in fishing gear. This\
      \ satisfies the definition, but is it intentionally included? It fits oddly\
      \ with the label as dogs are not marine life.\r\n\r\nI think it's good to be\
      \ pedantic here, to quote\r\nhttps://marinedebris.noaa.gov/sites/default/files/mdp_entanglement.pdf\r\
      \n\r\n_Inconsistencies in defining and distinguishing marine debris from actively\
      \ fished gear significantly limits assessments of marine debris entanglement\
      \ rates_\r\n\r\nI suggest:\r\n\r\n * entanglement in marine debris: _An environmental\
      \ process in which organisms become entangled in marine debris arising from\
      \ human activity. Example of marine debris include boating gear, fishing gear\
      \ (active or derelict). Marine debris may be in the water or on land._\r\n\r\
      \n(and placed under anthropogenic process - we can ultimately infer this placement)\r\
      \n\r\nI would also suggest including marine debris as its own class with its\
      \ own precise definition and subclasses and linking it to the entanglement process.\
      \ This class can also be reused when we come to define things such as marine\
      \ organisms consuming marine debris and accumulating it in their digestive systems\r\
      \n\r\n[apologies if I am overloading your request, some of these are things\
      \ that the envo team can address as a second pass]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
    - "Weathering; I would remove the adjective \"undesirable\". Weathering happens\
      \ whether it is desired or not. And if I desire it to happen it does not cease\
      \ to be weathering.\r\n\r\nWe should also think about the structures/patterns\
      \ for children of this term. I believe there are two main axes, that could be\
      \ captured by two design patterns/differentia:\r\n\r\n * the input to the process\
      \ (e.g. rocks vs substances such as synthetic substances applied to buildings)\r\
      \n * the causal agents and processes: broadly chemical vs mechanical (but these\
      \ may interplay)\r\n\r\nUsing this scheme the examples  can be precisely categorized.\
      \ E.g\r\n\r\n * ozone-induced stress cracking of rubbers\r\n * physical disintegration\

      \ How should we relate them"
    - "@cmungall thank you for your insight and the comments, I appreciate the input.\r\
      \n\r\nHere are some comments from my side:\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\
      \n**Entanglement**\r\n> this sounds very generic, and your definition source\
      \ is a lexicon rather than an authoritative environmental source.\r\n\r\nOur\
      \ idea for this term was based off of us wanted to add something along the lines\
      \ of \u201Centanglement of marine life\u201D. We thought it would be best to\
      \ have a generic superclass (i.e. \u201Centanglement\u201D) which would cover\
      \ the general use of the term. From our side there would be no problem with\
      \ moving it under anthropogenic process, since you suggested that this might\
      \ be more appropriate.  \r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n**Entanglement\
      \ of marine life**\r\n> Consider a dog on a beach entangled in fishing gear.\
      \ This satisfies the definition, but is it intentionally included?\r\n\r\nYes,\
      \ I see what you mean with this example, so we should definitely clear that\
      \ up. Changing the term to \u201Centanglement in marine debris\u201D would work\
      \ just as well from our side\r\n\r\n> I would also suggest including marine\
      \ debris as its own class with its own precise definition\r\n\r\nThis is an\
      \ issue we had discussed amongst ourselves before (particularly when adding\
      \ the terms \u201Cmarine anthropogenic litter\u201D, \u201Clittering\u201D and\
      \ when editing \u201Canthropogenic litter\u201D). In those cases we addressed\
      \ the fact that there seems to be no agreement in regards to what distinguishes\
      \ litter and debris in the form of a comment. This is something which we would\
      \ like to point out to UN Environment as we could not find agreed upon classifications\
      \ in the literature.\r\n\r\n> entanglement in marine debris: An environmental\
      \ process in which organisms become entangled in marine debris arising from\
      \ human activity. Example of marine debris include boating gear, fishing gear\
      \ (active or derelict). Marine debris may be in the water or on land.\r\n\r\n\
      I think that the way you phrased it is much clearer so I will implement these\
      \ changes.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\n**Weathering**\r\n\r\n> I\
      \ would remove the adjective \"undesirable\". Weathering happens whether it\
      \ is desired or not. And if I desire it to happen it does not cease to be weathering.\r\
      \n\r\nI agree, I will implement this as well.\r\n\r\n> We should also think\
      \ about the structures/patterns for children of this term. I believe there are\
      \ two main axes, that could be captured by two design patterns/differentia\r\
      \n\r\nI'm not sure I fully understand how we should implement this. Is your\
      \ idea that we have different terms within \"weathering\" which describe different\
      \ inputs and causal agents?\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nFor now I\
      \ will make the changes you suggested. Thanks again for the suggestions!"

  - I think this fits better under [planned environmental usage process](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001436),
    and one should be clear about who is doing the catching.
  - ">The anthropogenic environmental process during which abandoned, lost, and discarded\
    \ fishing gear continues to attract and entangle target and non-target species.\r\
    \n\r\n* \"The\" should be the indefinite article instead,\r\n* I'd replace \"\
    ...lost, and discarded\" with \"...lost, or discarded\"\r\n* I'd remove \"continues\
    \ to\" \r\n\r\nThis makes sense under anthropogenic environmental process. "
  - disposed of by whom?
  - '"A state of disuse" is very fuzzy - can you be more concrete? Is that even necessary?'
  - lost = "not been found" is a bit off - please tighten that up
  - German interpretations could include "fischen" and "angeln" (in case you'd like
    to add some multilingual support)
  - "> Fishing gear which has been purposefully left by the owner.\r\n\r\nThe way\
    \ it is phrased now would also include fishing gear that has e.g. been moved onto\
    \ a ship to prepare for an expedition, left there in its designated space, and\
    \ is ready to be used when needed. I'd argue that we wouldn't want that to fall\
    \ under \"abandoned fishing gear\"\r\n\r\nThe previous definition was more clear:\r\
    \n> Fishing gear which has been purposefully left by the owner to fall into a\
    \ state  of disuse.\r\n\r\n@pbuttigieg @iwilkie How would you propose making the\
    \ \"state of disuse\" less \"fuzzy\"?"
  - "Would this be clearer:\r\n\r\n> Fishing gear which has been purposefully left\
    \ by the owner and will not be returned to.\r\n\r\nI do feel as though it is not\
    \ as clear as the way it was phrased before with \"left [...] to fall into a state\
    \ of disuse\"."
  - ">entangles target and non-target species\r\n\r\nI think just saying \"entangles\
    \ organisms.\" is enough. The targeting is not relevant anymore. "
  - ">It is not necessarily driven by the actions of humans, but has been prepared\
    \ by human actions\r\n\r\nSomewhat awkwardly phrased. Do you mean \"While not\
    \ driven by humans directly, ghost fishing is a downstream result of they intentional\
    \ actions\" or similar?"
  - ">has been purposefully left by the owner\r\n\r\nDoesn't quite work. One can purposefully\
    \ leave things around without abandoning them. \r\n\r\nPerhaps: Fishing gear which\
    \ is not under the control of or maintained by its original custodian."
  - ">Fishing gear which is unable to be found and remains in the environment.\r\n\
    \r\nThis is more a definition of unfindable fishing gear, which is an interesting\
    \ idea, but not what we're going for. \r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\nFishing gear\

    does anyone want to mark that envo curators were the source of the definition
    a different way?
  - '@ddooley I think it is probably best to use oboInOwl:source (or dc:source), whatever
    ENVO uses, instead of hasDBXref..'
  - If I'm not mistaken ENVO uses hasdbxref as annotation on definitions to point
    to definition source.  (Personally, given that a term should have only one definition
    I have been fine with the IAO:0000118 definition source annotation on the term
    itself that other projects use).  At any rate I did a pull request https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/pull/1309  to
    get rid of the bad hasDBXrefs.

      Clinic is in red as a highlight for the issue I should have commented [edit:\
      \ I see I did leave a comment there] - a discussion of how general a term it\
      \ should be.  As a human construction, does it have broader semantics than just\
      \ a human medical domain?  I'm guessing animal health can be included too, e.g.\
      \ veterinary clinic.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm moving towards labelling most hospital\
      \ units to include facility at end."

    - So where it says ENVO basically we didn't draw on any other resource for the
      definition. Often that was because there seemed to be no easy reference to a
      definition for the term or phrase alone, e.g. "subway train".  Should I just
      leave that field empty then?
    - 'I would say briefly try to find something like a Wikipedia reference, these
      are definitional database cross references not claiming to be exact definition
      sources but if there is no such obvious reference then I would say just just
      leave the field empty. '

    - Ah - so we were unaware of Jagadish adding the intensive care unit / neonatal
      intensive care unit terms, so this is a collision of two requests for the same
      term showing up in ENVO draft.  I guess his was a smaller request so got approved
      well before our big chunk of terms.  What would you like for deprecation/replacement?  There
      is a "facility" pattern here meant to emphasize the material parts not the organizational
      parts, which OMRSE has more in its domain.
    - "oh I see that's interesting so coincidentally we had two PRs from two different\

    \ For example, stating this is `formed as a result of` some `combustion process`\

    \n\r\nRephrase to \"Masonry cement which is composed primarily of elastic polymers\
    \ mixed in a solvent\"\r\n\r\nThe axioms include \r\n* `alcohol` as a part, but\

    \ instances of `rubber cement` this should be removed. \r\n* `rubber particle`\
    \  - this does not align to the textual definition. Consider modifying the textual\
    \ definition to include it or remove it."
  - "This should be under `environmental material` or a subclass thereof. Consider\
    \ `[glue](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00003076)` - it's imperfect, but\
    \ better. \r\n\r\n`methyl cellulose` and `water` are in the axioms, but not mentioned\
    \ in the textual definition. \r\nRephrase the latter to \"A glue which is composed\
    \ primarily of methyl cellulose and water, and used to fix wallpaper to walls.\"\
    \ or similar"
  - "The definition and placement have no meaningful semantics regarding the composition\
    \ of `permanent hair dye`. \r\nThe textual definition is not sufficiently linked\
    \ to the axioms either.\r\n\r\nLooks like there should be a sub-hierarchy for\
    \ \"dyes\", but that's more a role than anything metaphysical. \r\n\r\nLooking\
    \ at the axioms, this is more (skipping better superclasses) \"A liquid environmental\
    \ material which is 1) manufactured, 2) composed primarily of hydrogen peroxide\
    \ and ammonia 3) used to permanently alter hair colour\" \r\n\r\nOn 2) I don't\
    \ know if these are the primary constituents, but you get the idea - we need differntia\
    \ in the textual and axiomatic definitions focused on what the thing is, rather\
    \ than its role.\r\n\r\nOn 3) - nothing permanently does anything - what is the\
    \ actual standard threshold for a dye to be considered \"permanent\"?"
  - 'Consider the comments above - same issues here. There should be an ink hierarchy,
    probably dovetailing with the dye hierarchy, focusing on the actual chemical properties
    of these materials (which include aromatic groups or similar that absorb visible
    light) '
  - "Perhaps improving the definition of \"ink\" ENVO:03510065 and moving this under\
    \ it will help.\r\n"
  - "Move to env material hierarchy - is there no CHEBI role for colourant? That would\
    \ help us with inks, dyes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe textual definition has a few issues:\r\
    \n>A manufactured product which contains a colourant that is used to imprint upon\
    \ materials.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to use it to imprint on anything in order for\
    \ it to be ink (intended use vs. realised role), maybe the capable of relation/wording\
    \ is better to support later axiomatisation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps: \"An environmental\
    \ material which contains at least one substance capable of absorbing light in\
    \ the visible range\"\r\n\r\n"
  - ">A slow drying ink which is made from refined soybean oil.\r\n\r\nThe \"slow\
    \ drying\" is extraneous and messes up the definition pattern.\r\nOn the axioms,\
    \ I don't think the pigments have to be biological - that axiom should be broadened\
    \ \r\n"
  - ">A coloring agent which is used to deposit color onto a substrate via an inkjet\
    \ printer.\r\n\r\nAgain, the definition pattern is off. Further, this definition\
    \ doesn't make sense. The colouring agent isn't used to deposit anything. \r\n\
    \r\nGiven that you have wax, resin, and aqueous inks noted, it would make sense\
    \ to include defined (with equivalence axioms) subclasses of ink to contain them.\
    \ Not essential, but would be good to take the opportunity."
  - As above, the definition and positioning are off/inaccurate
  - "The parent of 'emissions from petroleum combustion' is now 'environmental material'.\
    \ The definition has been adapted as well, and an axiom for 'produced_by' some\
    \ 'combustion process' has been included. We did not find a suitable example to\
    \ model the occurs in relationship after.\r\n"
  - 'The definition has been revised for ''rubber cement'' to reflect this recommendation.
    Axioms regarding the inclusion of ''rubber particle'' and ''alcohol'' have been
    maintained (as they are accurate for all instances of rubber cement) and can be
    added to the textual definition if required. '
  - '''Wallpaper paste'' has been placed as a subclass of glue and the textual definition
    modified as recommended. '
  - "In references to the variety of terms that fall under the category of ink/dye/colorant\
    \ etc. We have included two new subclasses of 'environmental material' called\
    \ 'colorant fluid' and 'chemical colorant'. Both are considered manufactured.\
    \ \r\nBelow these two classes the following have become subclasses:\r\nUnder 'colorant\
    \ fluid': 'pharmaceutical ink', 'gel ink', 'soy ink', ' and 'aqueous inkjet printer\
    \ ink'\r\nUnder 'chemical colorant': 'permanent hair dye'\r\n\r\nAll definitions\
    \ for these indicated subclasses have been updated to reflect their classification\
    \ and composition with recommendations taken from your notes. Please advise any\
    \ further revisions. Thanks!"
  - Thanks @laurenechan - will examine the latest files
  - Thanks @laurenechan - 'colorant fluid' and chemical colorant still sound very
    role-based - I'll look at the latest file to see how this can work.

    - "Hey @laurenechan I'm wondering if you can leverage owl equivalence axioms to\
      \ allow for entailment and inference from the reasoner. I'd suggest you take\
      \ a look at Chris mungall's blog post on [rector-normalization](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/ontotip-learn-the-rector-normalization-technique/)\
      \ (the rest of the blog is also a treasure trove which I'm slowly working through).\r\
      \n\r\nThe long and short of it is that when you have equivalence classes that\
      \ expresses conditions, e.g., `class 1` has properties `A, B and C`, and `class\
      \ 2` has properties `A and B`, then the reasoner can figure out that `class\
      \ 1` should be subclass to `class 2`. Similarly here, mixtures will have sets\
      \ of parts, if you list each out as a sum of it's parts within owl equivalence\
      \ class axioms, (as per @diatomsRcool's example: e.g., Rubber cement = manufactured\
      \ product and has part some X1 and has part some X2....etc), you'll allow the\
      \ reasoner to figure out the hierarchy of mixture classes. I did a little demo\
      \ similar to this idea [here](https://github.com/Southern-Cross-Plant-Science/cdno/issues/4#issuecomment-677436009)\
      \ just look at that comment (don't worry about the rest of the thread). \r\n\

      \ use [ODK](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/tree/master/odk)\

    - I'm guessing the soybean oil mentioned above is food-grade soybean oil?  I think
      the semantic wiggle room with a food product is that its manufacture meets health
      and organoleptic standards; whether it is actually used as food or goes to waste,
      or ends up in playdough or some other intention does not preclude referencing
      it.

      \ (if not this is just wrong).\r\n\r\nSo what is your suggestion for these three\
      \ cases:\r\n\r\n1) A mixture `A` can be exhaustively defined as a mix of a set\

      \ `A` is contains (among others) one of two compounds, for example, \"sugar\
      \ or sweetener\".\r\n\r\nIs it {`A sub: hasCompound some C1`,  `A sub hasCompound\
      \ some C2`,...} for both 1 and 2? And A sub hasCompound some (C4 or C5) is considered\

    - '@laurenechan I''m not in a position to approve this but once points A) - E)
      are settled by the senior editors @pbuttigieg and @cmungall, I have created
      a [ENVO-Robot-template-and-merge-workflow](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/ENVO-Robot-template-and-merge-workflow)
      workflow which you could leverage. The steps for ontology engineers section,
      and the robot template strings in the example google sheet are relevant to you,
      (i.e. how to merge a template into ENVO without creating a big mess, see https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/pull/1043). '
    - "After talking to @cmungall about the modelling in this PR, I now understand\
      \ my modelling error. The problem is that modelling mixtures as an intersection\
      \ (a sequence of AND statements) of existential restrictions (has part some\
      \ mixture part) is only half of the equation - what is missing is \"closure\"\
      . Before I explain this @laurenechan sorry that this very general discussion\
      \ here is being had on your ticket - this has nothing to do with your terms,\
      \ and is a general discussion on a pattern.\r\n\r\nRight now, when I say:\r\n\
      \r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution A:\r\ncoffee = mixture that has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water\r\ntiramisu = mixture that has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water and has part some sugar\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe would\
      \ get that Tiramisu is a kind of coffee - which is obviously bogus - it just\
      \ contains coffee (please don't judge my recipe above - it needs some work).\
      \ So the correct way to model this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution\
      \ B:\r\ncoffee = mixture that has part some coffee beans and has part some water\
      \ and has part only (coffee beans or water)\r\ntiramisu = mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part some sugar and has\
      \ part only (coffee beans or water or sugar)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we get a bit\
      \ into rococco land (@cmungall way of saying: complex OWL that is easy to get\
      \ wrong and unusable by external tools).\r\n\r\nFor completeness, I just add\
      \ modeling solution C&D as well, so we have them all in the same comment:\r\n\
      ```\r\n# Modeling solution C:\r\ncoffee subclassof mixture has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water\r\ntiramisu subclassof mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part some sugar\r\n```\r\
      \n\r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution D:\r\ncoffee subclassof mixture \r\ncoffee\
      \ subclassof has part some coffee beans \r\ncoffee subclassof has part some\
      \ water\r\ntiramisu subclassof mixture \r\ntiramisu subclassof has part some\
      \ coffee beans \r\ntiramisu subclassof has part some water \r\ntiramisu subclassof\
      \ has part some sugar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\n- Solution A: Is logically\
      \ wrong and must not be used. Its simply false - so there is no further discussion\
      \ needed (mea culpa)\r\n- Solution B: Is logically fine. \r\n   - Pro: \r\n\
      \      - The only solution where mixtures can be automatically classified using\
      \ a reasoner\r\n      - With solution C the only solution with access to an\
      \ \"exhaustive list\" of compounds - the other ones have ingredient lists, but\
      \ due to the open-world assumption, you cant assume them to be exhaustive (Please\
      \ read @cmungall entertaining \"[Open World considered harmful](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2020/09/04/the-open-world-assumption-considered-harmful/)\"\
      \ article.\r\n   - Contra:\r\n      - Rococo\r\n      - needs HermiT (big drawback!\
      \ You cant use ELK)\r\n- Solution C: Just for completeness. Is not wrong, but\
      \ should be avoided.\r\n    - Pro: nothing comes to mind that is not covered\
      \ by B.\r\n    - Contra: \r\n       - Rococo with no real benefits. No autoclassification.\r\
      \n- Solution D: \r\n   - Pro: that is what the users want (a simple way to get\
      \ the compounds of a mixture). Easy to maintain. \r\n   - Contra: No autoclassification.\
      \ No access to \"exhaustive list\".\r\n\r\nIts obvious that only solutions B\
      \ and D matter to this discussion. I can't tell you what to do @kaiiam, but\
      \ here is my preferred solution (MIX_ALT1):\r\n\r\n1. Use Solution B, but add\
      \ a separate module to ENVO that _asserts_ the subsumption derived from the\
      \ mixtures. Here is an example of how we do this as part of [DPO](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-phenotype-ontology/blob/072665bfa9abf70a1eae240f661ab09f64a20d99/src/ontology/dpo.Makefile#L118).\
      \ This allows you to use ELK in your day2day business and only need Hermit (or\
      \ Konclude, which is what we do) once when you create a release.\r\n2. Make\
      \ sure that you run ROBOT relax on the OWL product after compiling the pattern\
      \ this gives you some version of D as well.\r\n\r\nThe alternative MIX_ALT2\
      \ is this:\r\n1. Go with Solution D, but add a dosdp pattern that states that\
      \ if you are a mixture, your ingredient list can be considered exhaustive. \r\
      \n2. You need to manually assert all subsumptions between mixtures.\r\n\r\n\
      Let me know what you think. To alleviate some of the stress of @diatomsRcool\
      \ and @laurenechan you can also just add the terms so they can consider the\
      \ matter closed, while we still figure out how to do the modelling.\r\n\r\n"
    - "solution B is not correct because it mixes universals and transitive predicates.\
      \ Tiramisu and coffee both have atoms and quarks.\r\n\r\n(I know you know this\
      \ and just forgot... :-)\r\n\r\n(aside: this kind of trap is why I always say:\
      \ keep it simple. avoid non-EL constructs unless you're really sure they are\
      \ necessary for reasoning)\r\n\r\nOne way to get around this is to invent a\
      \ non-transitive subpredicate. RO has has_component for this purpose. But this\
      \ is problematic. Inference will be incomplete since sometimes you want the\
      \ transitivity\r\n\r\nAnother way is to do this.\r\n\r\n`mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part only (coffee beans\
      \ or water or (part-of some coffee beans) or (part-of some water))`\r\n\r\n\
      but this is complex, you'll never get classification from elk"
    - "Ahhhhh!!! How embarrassing!!!\r\n\r\nThat was a long ticket and one that illustrates\
      \ nicely the problem of complicated modelling.\r\n\r\nOK, I guess I suggest\
      \ then to go for `MIX_ALT2` solution.\r\n\r\nIf no one disagrees, I will finalise\
      \ the template with Lauren, and @kaiiam can merge it in. Thanks for all the\
      \ feedback!\r\n"

  - "Not sure why these would be added, they already exist. \r\n\r\nThere are a number\
    \ of insert/deletions that seem superfluous - likely harmless, but please confirm\
    \ you're using the latest version of Protege"
  - Same here - does this not already exist?
  - The definition and placement look good - but wouldn't there be subclass axioms
    following the textual definition? Using `RO:composed primarily of` and some CHEBI
    [polysaccharides](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CHEBI_18154)?
  - "This, and several other classes, are asserted subclasses of [manufactured product](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00003074).\
    \ While not wrong, this should be done by inference [1] and the asserted subclass\
    \ should be somewhere in the environmental material hierarchy. \r\n\r\nI'd also\
    \ add axioms like `'has quality' some 'quality of a liquid'` so that it gets reasoned\
    \ into the `liquid environmental material` hierarchy, unless you assert it to\
    \ be there.\r\n\r\n[1] After moving this to a good spot in the material hierarchy,\
    \ add `'output of' some 'manufacturing process'` to the subclass axioms and it\
    \ will be reasoned into the manufactured product hierarchy. "
  - The definition here is a little off - this may be better when this class is positioned
    (asserted) in the right place. Something like "A liquid environmental material
    which ..." if you place it there
  - As above, this should have a more informative superclass ([oil](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002985)?)
    and use subclass axioms to be inferred into manufactured product.
  - Good asserted positioning, but I'd add that subclass axiom to have this inferred
    into manufactured product.
  - I am getting rid of this declaration now, but I notice that there are a large
    number of these in ENVO - unnecessary declarations. Perhaps good to clean up sep.

      \ in the mixture terms:\r\n- Mixtures with differing quantities of components\
      \ (some have 2, some have 10+)\r\n- Mixtures with \"potential\" components,\

      \ the mixture terms\r\n- We are primarily interested in using ChEBI terms for\
      \ these, but also have ENVO and FoodOn terms included in some mixtures\r\n\r\
      \nThe ultimate goal from our use cases is to be able to identify if organism\
      \ A is exposed to a variety of mixtures, environments, etc., and organism B\
      \ is exposed to a completely different variety of mixtures etc, yet they have\
      \ some similar disease/phenotype/outcome, what are the individual components\
      \ each organism is exposed to (parts of mixtures) that may be similar and potentially\

    - "Hey @laurenechan I'm wondering if you can leverage owl equivalence axioms to\
      \ allow for entailment and inference from the reasoner. I'd suggest you take\
      \ a look at Chris mungall's blog post on [rector-normalization](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/ontotip-learn-the-rector-normalization-technique/)\
      \ (the rest of the blog is also a treasure trove which I'm slowly working through).\r\
      \n\r\nThe long and short of it is that when you have equivalence classes that\
      \ expresses conditions, e.g., `class 1` has properties `A, B and C`, and `class\
      \ 2` has properties `A and B`, then the reasoner can figure out that `class\
      \ 1` should be subclass to `class 2`. Similarly here, mixtures will have sets\
      \ of parts, if you list each out as a sum of it's parts within owl equivalence\
      \ class axioms, (as per @diatomsRcool's example: e.g., Rubber cement = manufactured\
      \ product and has part some X1 and has part some X2....etc), you'll allow the\
      \ reasoner to figure out the hierarchy of mixture classes. I did a little demo\
      \ similar to this idea [here](https://github.com/Southern-Cross-Plant-Science/cdno/issues/4#issuecomment-677436009)\
      \ just look at that comment (don't worry about the rest of the thread). \r\n\
      \r\nMy suggestion would be for you to just play around with this idea, you could\
      \ use [ODK](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/tree/master/odk)\
      \ to launch yourself a test application ontology, or even simpler just clone\

    - "Hi @laurenechan \r\n\r\nI think robot is a decent best choice here as you have\
      \ a variable number of members of the mixture, and the only way to do this in\

      \ be a some-some axiom\r\n - I would try and restrict the members to be purely\
      \ chebi, or existing envo materials. You have one with SIO. SIO is a great ontology,\
      \ but we don't have it in our import chain, and including it will introduce\
      \ difficulties\r\n - [soybean oil](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_03302776)\
      \ is less problematic as we have a foodon import, but I think it is good engineering\

      \ just go ahead and add ink and add subclasses."
    - I'm guessing the soybean oil mentioned above is food-grade soybean oil?  I think
      the semantic wiggle room with a food product is that its manufacture meets health
      and organoleptic standards; whether it is actually used as food or goes to waste,
      or ends up in playdough or some other intention does not preclude referencing
      it.

      \ of compounds in the mixture is exhaustive? So lets say they are exhaustive\
      \ (if not this is just wrong).\r\n\r\nSo what is your suggestion for these three\
      \ cases:\r\n\r\n1) A mixture `A` can be exhaustively defined as a mix of a set\
      \ of compounds {C1, C2, C3}. \r\n2) A mixture `A` can be partially defined as\
      \ containing a set of compounds (and more, just not clear what)\r\n3) A mixture\
      \ `A` is contains (among others) one of two compounds, for example, \"sugar\
      \ or sweetener\".\r\n\r\nIs it {`A sub: hasCompound some C1`,  `A sub hasCompound\
      \ some C2`,...} for both 1 and 2? And A sub hasCompound some (C4 or C5) is considered\
      \ too rococo?\r\n\r\n> don't include potential members with has-part. even if\
      \ you weaken your axioms from EC to SC, it will still be an all-some axiom.\
      \ potential members would be a some-some axiom\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I thought\
      \ @laurenechan checked that -> if not, revise this.. Potential members cant\
      \ be included like this. Is there a reason for why your usecase would require\
      \ _potential_ members Lauren?\r\n\r\n> not clear the foodon class is correct\
      \ here, as it bakes in the assumption the product is created with the intention\

    - '@laurenechan I''m not in a position to approve this but once points A) - E)
      are settled by the senior editors @pbuttigieg and @cmungall, I have created
      a [ENVO-Robot-template-and-merge-workflow](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/ENVO-Robot-template-and-merge-workflow)
      workflow which you could leverage. The steps for ontology engineers section,
      and the robot template strings in the example google sheet are relevant to you,

    - "After talking to @cmungall about the modelling in this PR, I now understand\
      \ my modelling error. The problem is that modelling mixtures as an intersection\
      \ (a sequence of AND statements) of existential restrictions (has part some\
      \ mixture part) is only half of the equation - what is missing is \"closure\"\
      . Before I explain this @laurenechan sorry that this very general discussion\
      \ here is being had on your ticket - this has nothing to do with your terms,\
      \ and is a general discussion on a pattern.\r\n\r\nRight now, when I say:\r\n\
      \r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution A:\r\ncoffee = mixture that has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water\r\ntiramisu = mixture that has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water and has part some sugar\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe would\
      \ get that Tiramisu is a kind of coffee - which is obviously bogus - it just\
      \ contains coffee (please don't judge my recipe above - it needs some work).\
      \ So the correct way to model this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution\
      \ B:\r\ncoffee = mixture that has part some coffee beans and has part some water\
      \ and has part only (coffee beans or water)\r\ntiramisu = mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part some sugar and has\
      \ part only (coffee beans or water or sugar)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we get a bit\
      \ into rococco land (@cmungall way of saying: complex OWL that is easy to get\
      \ wrong and unusable by external tools).\r\n\r\nFor completeness, I just add\
      \ modeling solution C&D as well, so we have them all in the same comment:\r\n\
      ```\r\n# Modeling solution C:\r\ncoffee subclassof mixture has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water\r\ntiramisu subclassof mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part some sugar\r\n```\r\
      \n\r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution D:\r\ncoffee subclassof mixture \r\ncoffee\
      \ subclassof has part some coffee beans \r\ncoffee subclassof has part some\
      \ water\r\ntiramisu subclassof mixture \r\ntiramisu subclassof has part some\
      \ coffee beans \r\ntiramisu subclassof has part some water \r\ntiramisu subclassof\
      \ has part some sugar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\n- Solution A: Is logically\
      \ wrong and must not be used. Its simply false - so there is no further discussion\
      \ needed (mea culpa)\r\n- Solution B: Is logically fine. \r\n   - Pro: \r\n\
      \      - The only solution where mixtures can be automatically classified using\
      \ a reasoner\r\n      - With solution C the only solution with access to an\
      \ \"exhaustive list\" of compounds - the other ones have ingredient lists, but\
      \ due to the open-world assumption, you cant assume them to be exhaustive (Please\
      \ read @cmungall entertaining \"[Open World considered harmful](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2020/09/04/the-open-world-assumption-considered-harmful/)\"\
      \ article.\r\n   - Contra:\r\n      - Rococo\r\n      - needs HermiT (big drawback!\
      \ You cant use ELK)\r\n- Solution C: Just for completeness. Is not wrong, but\
      \ should be avoided.\r\n    - Pro: nothing comes to mind that is not covered\
      \ by B.\r\n    - Contra: \r\n       - Rococo with no real benefits. No autoclassification.\r\
      \n- Solution D: \r\n   - Pro: that is what the users want (a simple way to get\
      \ the compounds of a mixture). Easy to maintain. \r\n   - Contra: No autoclassification.\
      \ No access to \"exhaustive list\".\r\n\r\nIts obvious that only solutions B\
      \ and D matter to this discussion. I can't tell you what to do @kaiiam, but\
      \ here is my preferred solution (MIX_ALT1):\r\n\r\n1. Use Solution B, but add\
      \ a separate module to ENVO that _asserts_ the subsumption derived from the\
      \ mixtures. Here is an example of how we do this as part of [DPO](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-phenotype-ontology/blob/072665bfa9abf70a1eae240f661ab09f64a20d99/src/ontology/dpo.Makefile#L118).\
      \ This allows you to use ELK in your day2day business and only need Hermit (or\
      \ Konclude, which is what we do) once when you create a release.\r\n2. Make\
      \ sure that you run ROBOT relax on the OWL product after compiling the pattern\
      \ this gives you some version of D as well.\r\n\r\nThe alternative MIX_ALT2\
      \ is this:\r\n1. Go with Solution D, but add a dosdp pattern that states that\
      \ if you are a mixture, your ingredient list can be considered exhaustive. \r\
      \n2. You need to manually assert all subsumptions between mixtures.\r\n\r\n\
      Let me know what you think. To alleviate some of the stress of @diatomsRcool\
      \ and @laurenechan you can also just add the terms so they can consider the\
      \ matter closed, while we still figure out how to do the modelling.\r\n\r\n"
    - "solution B is not correct because it mixes universals and transitive predicates.\
      \ Tiramisu and coffee both have atoms and quarks.\r\n\r\n(I know you know this\
      \ and just forgot... :-)\r\n\r\n(aside: this kind of trap is why I always say:\
      \ keep it simple. avoid non-EL constructs unless you're really sure they are\
      \ necessary for reasoning)\r\n\r\nOne way to get around this is to invent a\
      \ non-transitive subpredicate. RO has has_component for this purpose. But this\
      \ is problematic. Inference will be incomplete since sometimes you want the\
      \ transitivity\r\n\r\nAnother way is to do this.\r\n\r\n`mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part only (coffee beans\
      \ or water or (part-of some coffee beans) or (part-of some water))`\r\n\r\n\
      but this is complex, you'll never get classification from elk"
    - "Ahhhhh!!! How embarrassing!!!\r\n\r\nThat was a long ticket and one that illustrates\
      \ nicely the problem of complicated modelling.\r\n\r\nOK, I guess I suggest\
      \ then to go for `MIX_ALT2` solution.\r\n\r\nIf no one disagrees, I will finalise\
      \ the template with Lauren, and @kaiiam can merge it in. Thanks for all the\
      \ feedback!\r\n"

    - "Hi @kaiiam , here are some of the things we were hoping to be able to encompass\
      \ in the mixture terms:\r\n- Mixtures with differing quantities of components\
      \ (some have 2, some have 10+)\r\n- Mixtures with \"potential\" components,\
      \ i.e. some rubber cement is made with acetone and another is made with ethanol,\
      \ we hope to include all of the \"potential\" and \"certain\" components to\
      \ the mixture terms\r\n- We are primarily interested in using ChEBI terms for\
      \ these, but also have ENVO and FoodOn terms included in some mixtures\r\n\r\
      \nThe ultimate goal from our use cases is to be able to identify if organism\
      \ A is exposed to a variety of mixtures, environments, etc., and organism B\
      \ is exposed to a completely different variety of mixtures etc, yet they have\
      \ some similar disease/phenotype/outcome, what are the individual components\
      \ each organism is exposed to (parts of mixtures) that may be similar and potentially\
      \ is related to the outcome seen.\r\n \r\nIf we have inconsistent numbers of\

    - "Hey @laurenechan I'm wondering if you can leverage owl equivalence axioms to\
      \ allow for entailment and inference from the reasoner. I'd suggest you take\
      \ a look at Chris mungall's blog post on [rector-normalization](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/ontotip-learn-the-rector-normalization-technique/)\
      \ (the rest of the blog is also a treasure trove which I'm slowly working through).\r\
      \n\r\nThe long and short of it is that when you have equivalence classes that\
      \ expresses conditions, e.g., `class 1` has properties `A, B and C`, and `class\
      \ 2` has properties `A and B`, then the reasoner can figure out that `class\
      \ 1` should be subclass to `class 2`. Similarly here, mixtures will have sets\
      \ of parts, if you list each out as a sum of it's parts within owl equivalence\
      \ class axioms, (as per @diatomsRcool's example: e.g., Rubber cement = manufactured\
      \ product and has part some X1 and has part some X2....etc), you'll allow the\
      \ reasoner to figure out the hierarchy of mixture classes. I did a little demo\
      \ similar to this idea [here](https://github.com/Southern-Cross-Plant-Science/cdno/issues/4#issuecomment-677436009)\
      \ just look at that comment (don't worry about the rest of the thread). \r\n\
      \r\nMy suggestion would be for you to just play around with this idea, you could\
      \ use [ODK](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/tree/master/odk)\
      \ to launch yourself a test application ontology, or even simpler just clone\
      \ a \"sandbox\" version of ENVO to experiment in (just don't make any weird\
      \ pushes or pull requests from the sandbox version). \r\n\r\nLet me know if\
      \ these suggestions seem useful to you and if you have any questions, or want\
      \ to try this out, and want my help doing so. It would be ideal if you (or we)\
      \ can figure out some consistent owl equivalence   for the axioms of these classes.\
      \ If so we could later maybe implement them within design patterns such as those\
      \ produced by Robot or DOSDP. "
    - "Hi, \r\nI got the chance to do a little sandbox building for these mixtures\

    - "Hi @laurenechan \r\n\r\nI think robot is a decent best choice here as you have\
      \ a variable number of members of the mixture, and the only way to do this in\
      \ dosdp is with one pattern per cardinality (cc @matentzn )\r\n\r\nyour template\
      \ is a great start. unfortunately we haven't yet documented the schema for mixtures\
      \ in envo, some comments here:\r\n\r\n - we currently use 'environmental material'\
      \ as parent for all mixtures\r\n - I don't think all of these should be equivalence\
      \ axioms. In fact I don't think any of them should be. You'd have to close the\
      \ membership list (at least) for these to be valid equivalence axioms\r\n -\
      \ don't include potential members with has-part. even if you weaken your axioms\
      \ from EC to SC, it will still be an all-some axiom. potential members would\
      \ be a some-some axiom\r\n - I would try and restrict the members to be purely\
      \ chebi, or existing envo materials. You have one with SIO. SIO is a great ontology,\
      \ but we don't have it in our import chain, and including it will introduce\
      \ difficulties\r\n - [soybean oil](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/FOODON_03302776)\
      \ is less problematic as we have a foodon import, but I think it is good engineering\

      \ am not so sure a template buys you much. I think you may be better adding\
      \ these the traditional way in Protege. You may also want to consider aligning\
      \ the textual definition with axioms more. You may want to flesh out a hierarchy\

      \ just go ahead and add ink and add subclasses."
    - I'm guessing the soybean oil mentioned above is food-grade soybean oil?  I think
      the semantic wiggle room with a food product is that its manufacture meets health
      and organoleptic standards; whether it is actually used as food or goes to waste,
      or ends up in playdough or some other intention does not preclude referencing
      it.
    - "This is my mess, sorry guys. \r\n\r\n> I don't think all of these should be\

      \ of compounds in the mixture is exhaustive? So lets say they are exhaustive\
      \ (if not this is just wrong).\r\n\r\nSo what is your suggestion for these three\
      \ cases:\r\n\r\n1) A mixture `A` can be exhaustively defined as a mix of a set\
      \ of compounds {C1, C2, C3}. \r\n2) A mixture `A` can be partially defined as\
      \ containing a set of compounds (and more, just not clear what)\r\n3) A mixture\
      \ `A` is contains (among others) one of two compounds, for example, \"sugar\
      \ or sweetener\".\r\n\r\nIs it {`A sub: hasCompound some C1`,  `A sub hasCompound\
      \ some C2`,...} for both 1 and 2? And A sub hasCompound some (C4 or C5) is considered\
      \ too rococo?\r\n\r\n> don't include potential members with has-part. even if\
      \ you weaken your axioms from EC to SC, it will still be an all-some axiom.\
      \ potential members would be a some-some axiom\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. I thought\
      \ @laurenechan checked that -> if not, revise this.. Potential members cant\
      \ be included like this. Is there a reason for why your usecase would require\
      \ _potential_ members Lauren?\r\n\r\n> not clear the foodon class is correct\
      \ here, as it bakes in the assumption the product is created with the intention\

      \ It's just easier like that during collaboration and while sorting out the\
      \ patterns. Lauren has already compiled it into OWL and checked it in Protege.\
      \ I agree that once we have at least some rudimentary agreement about these\
      \ terms, maybe its best to just assert the parts of the hierarchy that cant\
      \ be safely inferred... For that to happen, we first need to know: \r\n\r\n\
      1. what is the pattern for mixtures (see above), and \r\n2. is there any objection\

      \ dependency of the mixtures to just ENVO and ChEBI terms (EDIT: term requested\
      \ 12/1/2020)\r\nD) I have changed the genus of the definitions from ChEBI: mixture\

    - '@laurenechan I''m not in a position to approve this but once points A) - E)
      are settled by the senior editors @pbuttigieg and @cmungall, I have created
      a [ENVO-Robot-template-and-merge-workflow](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/ENVO-Robot-template-and-merge-workflow)
      workflow which you could leverage. The steps for ontology engineers section,
      and the robot template strings in the example google sheet are relevant to you,
      (i.e. how to merge a template into ENVO without creating a big mess, see https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/pull/1043). '
    - "After talking to @cmungall about the modelling in this PR, I now understand\
      \ my modelling error. The problem is that modelling mixtures as an intersection\
      \ (a sequence of AND statements) of existential restrictions (has part some\
      \ mixture part) is only half of the equation - what is missing is \"closure\"\
      . Before I explain this @laurenechan sorry that this very general discussion\
      \ here is being had on your ticket - this has nothing to do with your terms,\
      \ and is a general discussion on a pattern.\r\n\r\nRight now, when I say:\r\n\
      \r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution A:\r\ncoffee = mixture that has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water\r\ntiramisu = mixture that has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water and has part some sugar\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe would\
      \ get that Tiramisu is a kind of coffee - which is obviously bogus - it just\
      \ contains coffee (please don't judge my recipe above - it needs some work).\
      \ So the correct way to model this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution\
      \ B:\r\ncoffee = mixture that has part some coffee beans and has part some water\
      \ and has part only (coffee beans or water)\r\ntiramisu = mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part some sugar and has\
      \ part only (coffee beans or water or sugar)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we get a bit\
      \ into rococco land (@cmungall way of saying: complex OWL that is easy to get\
      \ wrong and unusable by external tools).\r\n\r\nFor completeness, I just add\
      \ modeling solution C&D as well, so we have them all in the same comment:\r\n\
      ```\r\n# Modeling solution C:\r\ncoffee subclassof mixture has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water\r\ntiramisu subclassof mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part some sugar\r\n```\r\
      \n\r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution D:\r\ncoffee subclassof mixture \r\ncoffee\
      \ subclassof has part some coffee beans \r\ncoffee subclassof has part some\
      \ water\r\ntiramisu subclassof mixture \r\ntiramisu subclassof has part some\
      \ coffee beans \r\ntiramisu subclassof has part some water \r\ntiramisu subclassof\
      \ has part some sugar\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\n\r\n- Solution A: Is logically\
      \ wrong and must not be used. Its simply false - so there is no further discussion\
      \ needed (mea culpa)\r\n- Solution B: Is logically fine. \r\n   - Pro: \r\n\
      \      - The only solution where mixtures can be automatically classified using\
      \ a reasoner\r\n      - With solution C the only solution with access to an\
      \ \"exhaustive list\" of compounds - the other ones have ingredient lists, but\
      \ due to the open-world assumption, you cant assume them to be exhaustive (Please\
      \ read @cmungall entertaining \"[Open World considered harmful](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2020/09/04/the-open-world-assumption-considered-harmful/)\"\
      \ article.\r\n   - Contra:\r\n      - Rococo\r\n      - needs HermiT (big drawback!\
      \ You cant use ELK)\r\n- Solution C: Just for completeness. Is not wrong, but\
      \ should be avoided.\r\n    - Pro: nothing comes to mind that is not covered\
      \ by B.\r\n    - Contra: \r\n       - Rococo with no real benefits. No autoclassification.\r\
      \n- Solution D: \r\n   - Pro: that is what the users want (a simple way to get\
      \ the compounds of a mixture). Easy to maintain. \r\n   - Contra: No autoclassification.\
      \ No access to \"exhaustive list\".\r\n\r\nIts obvious that only solutions B\
      \ and D matter to this discussion. I can't tell you what to do @kaiiam, but\
      \ here is my preferred solution (MIX_ALT1):\r\n\r\n1. Use Solution B, but add\
      \ a separate module to ENVO that _asserts_ the subsumption derived from the\
      \ mixtures. Here is an example of how we do this as part of [DPO](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-phenotype-ontology/blob/072665bfa9abf70a1eae240f661ab09f64a20d99/src/ontology/dpo.Makefile#L118).\
      \ This allows you to use ELK in your day2day business and only need Hermit (or\
      \ Konclude, which is what we do) once when you create a release.\r\n2. Make\
      \ sure that you run ROBOT relax on the OWL product after compiling the pattern\
      \ this gives you some version of D as well.\r\n\r\nThe alternative MIX_ALT2\
      \ is this:\r\n1. Go with Solution D, but add a dosdp pattern that states that\
      \ if you are a mixture, your ingredient list can be considered exhaustive. \r\
      \n2. You need to manually assert all subsumptions between mixtures.\r\n\r\n\
      Let me know what you think. To alleviate some of the stress of @diatomsRcool\
      \ and @laurenechan you can also just add the terms so they can consider the\
      \ matter closed, while we still figure out how to do the modelling.\r\n\r\n"
    - "solution B is not correct because it mixes universals and transitive predicates.\
      \ Tiramisu and coffee both have atoms and quarks.\r\n\r\n(I know you know this\
      \ and just forgot... :-)\r\n\r\n(aside: this kind of trap is why I always say:\
      \ keep it simple. avoid non-EL constructs unless you're really sure they are\
      \ necessary for reasoning)\r\n\r\nOne way to get around this is to invent a\
      \ non-transitive subpredicate. RO has has_component for this purpose. But this\
      \ is problematic. Inference will be incomplete since sometimes you want the\
      \ transitivity\r\n\r\nAnother way is to do this.\r\n\r\n`mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part only (coffee beans\
      \ or water or (part-of some coffee beans) or (part-of some water))`\r\n\r\n\
      but this is complex, you'll never get classification from elk"
    - "Ahhhhh!!! How embarrassing!!!\r\n\r\nThat was a long ticket and one that illustrates\
      \ nicely the problem of complicated modelling.\r\n\r\nOK, I guess I suggest\
      \ then to go for `MIX_ALT2` solution.\r\n\r\nIf no one disagrees, I will finalise\
      \ the template with Lauren, and @kaiiam can merge it in. Thanks for all the\
      \ feedback!\r\n"

      \r\nI love the blue ice-cream counter example! +1 for removing the logical def.\
      \ As for the label/synonym reflecting the meaning, I think based on conversations\
      \ with my professor, Dr. Hong Cui from the UA information school that it's better\
      \ to use the labels as they exist in the community rather then something new\
      \ or varying to much from what the domain scientists expect to see or already\
      \ use (a mistake library scientists made for a long time according to her).\
      \ But we can ask @rduerr if there are other blue ice synonyms or if she has\
      \ other suggestions. \r\n\r\n> clarify ice vs water ice\r\n\r\nTotally agree\
      \ on all points. Depending on @pbuttigieg's feedback I can make another PR and\
      \ try to fix the incorrect uses of `ice` intended to be `water ice`. Regarding\
      \ the multi-planetary use case I think it's good to leave that door open, but\
      \ not let it get in the way of representing things on here on earth (our primary\
      \ use case). \r\n\r\n> ice surface\r\n\r\nI agree that the duplication is confusing,\
      \ especially since these fiat ice surface classes are the only thing we have\
      \ under `continuant fiat boundary`. Since we don't know the extent to which\
      \ SWEET actually maps to BFO, perhaps we change the mapping of http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/IceSurface\
      \ from `two-dimensional fiat water ice surface` to `ice surface layer`?\r\n\r\

    - "OK weighing in here; I wasn't involved in all of these definitions; but did\
      \ notice based on this ticket that yes, there are some screwy things in the\
      \ current hierarchy, though they aren't quite the same things as @cmungall is\
      \ talking about, though I will try to address at least some of those comments\
      \ as well.  \r\n\r\nMy first complaint is that the terms under sea ice floe\
      \ (nilas, pancake ice, young ice) are not necessarily sea ice floes...  Two\
      \ of of those terms (frazil & shuga) plus all of the New ice terms and several\
      \ of the terms under sea ice (first year ice, multiyear ice, second year ice)\
      \ are actually terms describing the stages in the life of sea ice which starts\
      \ off as either frazil or shuga which then progresses to new ice and eventually\
      \ first-year, etc. ice.  Pancake ice is also not a floe it is an ice form. \
      \ In general the Earth sea ice community has standardized terminology along\
      \ 3 dimensions - concentration, form and stage (which is a proxy for age). \
      \ Yes, there are other terms in use; but those are the major characteristics\
      \ of Earth's sea water ice (even if NOAA uses some of the same terminology for\
      \ fresh water ice) and which show up everywhere in the literature and on sea\
      \ ice maps used by shipping companies, etc.  I suggest that concentration, form,\
      \ and stage are qualities that sea ice has?\r\n\r\nSecond there are glaciers\
      \ on both Mars and Pluto. I would say that glacier needs to come out from under\
      \ water ice since Pluto has glaciers made of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n> Continuing ice\

      > I'm not sure how this grouping class helps?\r\n\r\nI tend to agree - the issue\
      \ is that NOAA uses the same terms for young and new ice for Great Lakes ice\
      \ as they do for sea ice.  However, the ice on the great lakes melts out completely\
      \ each summer so the terms for late stages of the life of ice (e.g., first year,\
      \ second year, multiyear) don't apply.  Personally, I think we should just make\
      \ the Great Lakes a special subset that parallels the stages of sea ice but\
      \ doesn't include terms that don't apply.  As far as I know other countries\

    - "> The SWEET class traces back to a geometry class, so it's more in line with\

      \ a thesaurus that was built with loose use of subclass and no ontological commitment\
      \ to BFO.\r\n\r\naccording to SWEET an ice surface is both a planetary realm\

      \n\r\nThis doesn't make any sense from a BFO perspective, but it's totally fine\
      \ if you take the view that the hierarchy is just there to help people find\
      \ relevant concepts, like MESH, or a organization of items in a supermarket.\r\

      \ is justification for a particular BFO interpretation, or justification for\
      \ introducing complexity to ENVO\r\n\r\nGoing back to @kaiiam's question:\r\n\
      > Since we don't know the extent to which SWEET actually maps to BFO, perhaps\
      \ we change the mapping of http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/IceSurface from\
      \ two-dimensional fiat water ice surface to ice surface layer?\r\n\r\nI think\
      \ we do know the extent to which SWEET maps to BFO: zero. But yes, the suggestion\
      \ still stands, map to the more useful and intuitive \" ce surface layer\" in\
      \ ENVO and obsolete the confusing 2D classes."

      A cloud which is 1) is organised as a patch, sheet, or layer often with shading,\
      \ composed of laminae (a layer or layers), rounded masses, or rolls, which are\
      \ sometimes partly fibrous or diffuse and which may or may not be merged, 2)\

      A cloud which 1) is organised as a layer, 2) is composed of water droplets (sometimes\
      \ supercooled) and raindrops, of snow crystals and snowflakes, or of a mixture\
      \ of these liquid and solid particles, 3) occurs in the middle atmospheric level\
      \ (middle \xE9tage), 4) is diffused by more or less continuously falling rain\
      \ or snow, which in most cases reaches the ground, 5) is thick enough throughout\
      \ to blot out the appearance of the local star, 6) is grey, often dark grey\
      \ in colour.\r\n**Comment**\r\nLow, ragged clouds frequently occur below the\
      \ layer, with which they may or may not merge. Nimbostratus is almost always\
      \ found in the middle atmospheric level (middle \xE9tage), but it usually extends\
      \ into the other two levels.\r\n\r\n## Stratocumulus cloud\r\n**Definition**\

      A cloud which 1) is structurally organised as a patch, sheet or layer that a)\
      \ almost always has dark parts and b) is composed of non-fibrous tessellations,\
      \ rounded masses, rolls, and similar structural elements and which may or may\
      \ not be merged, 2) is composed of water droplets, sometimes accompanied by\
      \ raindrops or, more rarely, snow pellets, snow crystals and snowflakes, 3)\
      \ occurs in the low atmospheric level (low \xE9tage), 4) is grey or whitish,\
      \ or both grey and whitish in colour.\r\n**Comment**\r\nMost of the regularly\
      \ arranged small structural elements of stratocumulus clouds have an apparent\
      \ width of more than 5 degrees. Fibrous structural elements may emerge when\
      \ virga is formed.\r\n\r\n## Stratus cloud\r\n**Definition** [ENVO](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001413),\
      \ [WMO definition](https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/en/clouds-genera-stratus.html),\

      \ [WMO \xE9tage](https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/en/clouds-definitions.html)\r\n\
      A cloud which is 1) is structurally organised as a layer with a fairly uniform\
      \ base or, less frequently, ragged patches, 2) is usually composed of small\
      \ water droplets, 3) occurs in the low atmospheric level (low \xE9tage), 4)\
      \ is disposed to produce drizzle, snow or snow grains as preciptation, 5) may\
      \ allow a clearly visible outline of the local star to be seen through its mass,\

      \ [WMO \xE9tage](https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/en/clouds-definitions.html)\r\n\
      A cloud which 1) has the form of a dense mountain or one or more huge towers,\
      \ 2) is composed of water droplets and, especially in its upper portion, ice\
      \ crystals, 3) occurs in the low atmospheric level (low \xE9tage), 4) has a\
      \ considerable vertical extent, 5) is usually smooth, fibrous or striated, and\
      \ nearly always flattened across part of its upper portion, which often spreads\
      \ out in the shape of an anvil or vast plume, 6) has a very dark base which\
      \ may be merged with low ragged clouds which frequently form underneath this\
      \ cloud, 7) is frequently associated with precipitation, sometimes in the form\
      \ of virga.\r\n**Comment**\r\nCumulonimbus usually have their bases in the low\
      \ atmospheric level (low \xE9tage), but their vertical extent is often so great\
      \ that their tops may reach into the middle and high atmospheric levels (middle\
      \ and high \xE9tage). Cumulonimbus also contains large raindrops and, often,\
      \ snowflakes, snow pellets or hailstones. The water droplets and raindrops may\
      \ be substantially supercooled."
    comments:
    - "Thank you for this thorough assessment @raissameyer \r\nI think this brings\
      \ a good degree of systematics to the cloud hierarchy, so would welcome a pull\
      \ request with these revisions. \r\n\r\nSome issues include\r\n- the \u2601\uFE0F\
      fluffiness\u2601\uFE0F of terms like \"especially\", \"considerable\", \"nearly\
      \ always\" etc can those be made more precise? I see that this is actually the\
      \ language of the Cloud Atlas, which suggests that this is the limit of the\
      \ precision we can expect, however, we then have to think about how we can handle\
      \ this uncertainty smartly. What happens if you move all of those components\
      \ to the comment? Do the definitions of genera then start to overlap?\r\n- The\
      \ aspect of shading and dark/light parts seems very observer-centric, which\
      \ can lead to weaker definitions. What does the shading imply about the actual\
      \ structure/thickness of the cloud? Or is it not that simple?\r\n- \"may allow\
      \ a clearly visible outline of the local star to be seen through its mass\"\
      \ Is another observer-centric differentia that is difficult to work with. We're\
      \ assuming 20/20 human vision?  If there's a way to actually comment on the\
      \ density/thickness it would be better. Moving that to the comment is also an\
      \ option."

    - "More background on debris flow from the same source: Occurrence\r\nDebris flows\
      \ occur around the world and are prevalent in steep gullies\r\nand canyons;\
      \ they can be intensified when occurring on slopes or in\r\ngullies that have\
      \ been denuded of vegetation due to wildfires or forest\r\nlogging. They are\
      \ common in volcanic areas with weak soil.\r\nRelative size/range\r\nThese types\
      \ of flows can be thin and watery or thick with sediment and\r\ndebris and are\
      \ usually confined to the dimensions of the steep gullies\r\nthat facilitate\
      \ their downward movement. Generally the movement is\r\nrelatively shallow and\
      \ the runout is both long and narrow, sometimes\r\nextending for kilometers\
      \ in steep terrain. The debris and mud usually\r\nterminate at the base of the\
      \ slopes and create fanlike, triangular deposits\r\ncalled debris fans, which\
      \ may also be unstable.\r\nVelocity of travel\r\nCan be rapid to extremely rapid\
      \ (35 miles per hour or 56 km per hour)\r\ndepending on consistency and slope\
      \ angle.\r\nTriggering mechanisms\r\nDebris flows are commonly caused by intense\
      \ surface-water flow, due to\r\nheavy precipitation or rapid snowmelt, that\
      \ erodes and mobilizes loose\r\nsoil or rock on steep slopes. Debris flows also\
      \ commonly mobilize from\r\nother types of landslides that occur on steep slopes,\
      \ are nearly saturated,\r\nand consist of a large proportion of silt- and sand-sized\
      \ material.\r\nEffects (direct/indirect)\r\nDebris flows can be lethal because\
      \ of their rapid onset, high speed of\r\nmovement, and the fact that they can\
      \ incorporate large boulders and\r\nother pieces of debris. They can move objects\
      \ as large as houses in\r\ntheir downslope flow or can fill structures with\
      \ a rapid accumulation\r\nof sediment and organic matter. They can affect the\
      \ quality of water by\r\ndepositing large amounts of silt and debris."

      NPO models radiation, waves and energy in what appears to be a very sensible
      manner. It''s not clear if all of these are required to be imported in ENVO,
      but I can see this being useful in a variety of contexts. Energy is obviously
      an important concept when looking at some of the wider ENVO use cases.

    - '@kaiiam @rduerr yes, but are we prepared to say that all solids are ices? Perhaps
      we need "frozen ice" class to resolve this.'
    - Maybe even "gravitationally formed ice".

      \ science ices are volatile elements and compounds with low boiling points but\
      \ where the melting point is 100 K or more.  Whereas refractory substances (like\
      \ most rocks on Earth) have high boiling points. \r\n\r\nHowever, what's with\
      \ the gravitationally formed ice?  At least on Earth ice (meaning water ice)\
      \ isn't generally gravitationally formed, rather formed due to freezing (i.e.,\
      \ low temperatures)."
    - "I get that this technically makes sense in an astrogeological sense - but it\
      \ definitely reads a bit odd. However, another issue is that \"glass\" (which\
      \ is usually although I suppose not exclusively) man-made only appears under\

    - "seems like ice denotes a solid that is normally a liquid at Standard temperature\

      As far as glass, one very common kind of glass in EarthScience is volcanic glass,\
      \ certainly not anthropogenic. Doesn't glass denote a material that has undergone\
      \ a liquid-solid transition in such a way that no regular crystal lattice is\
      \ formed?  Nothing to do with anthropogenic as a sufficient property."
    - "Indeed, volcanic glass is the kind of thing I was thinking of when I said that\
      \ glass is not exclusively man-made. It feels like this existing path and term\

      \ the same term, or a separate term altogether, glass within the built-environment\
      \ needs to be included somehow."
    - "Ontologies can be a bit confusing where the super class is sourced from. the\

    - On a related note, I just got off a call with @mobb and @amoeba and we found
      several terms with dbxrefs that don't resolve -- they point to a LTER server
      that moved.  For example, `ocean` has a link to `http://129.24.124.196/vocab/vocab/index.php?tema=127&/coral-reefs`
      (this might be the wrong link too).  Should I update these xrefs?

    - 'What sorts of classes would you need specifically @misayasu? '
    - NCIT is actually well-axiomatized in the area of disease and cancer specifically.
      But due to its varied use cases it covers many different areas of biology and
      beyond. The general plan is to allow selective swapping out of areas with OBOs,
      you can see on http://obofoundry.org/ontology/ncit.html ncit-plus has the anatomy
      swapped out for Uberon/CL - we should do the same for PATO

  - Please add a comment here saying that "zones" will likely be aligned to BFO:site

  - "I suppose microbes are particulate matter, in a sense; however, I think that\

  - Can we not say `has input` instead of `has participant` here?
  - You can move the second sentence to a comment.

  - Hey @pbuttigieg @jzrapp I think adding the fact sea ice [floats on the ocean](http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/sotc/sea_ice.html)
    surface to the definition of sea ice address your concerns over the semantics
    of floating ice. I'm currently working on categorizing the [various stages of
    sea ice development](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary-terms/sea-ice?page=2)
    adding classes for new ice, nilas, young ice, and multiyear ice, all of which
    are to be subclasses of sea ice.
  - "@jzrapp This is more to indicate that the ice is on top of some medium upon which\

    how is the `thaw hole` different from a `melt pond channel`? If they're the same,
