    issue_title: Envo.owl Top Level Classes Don't Seem to have labels
    issue_body: "I just downloaded the main ontology -- envo.owl -- here: https://obofoundry.org/ontology/envo.html\
      \ and when I open it in Protege the top level classes don't seem to have rdfs:label\
      \ value so all I see are the codes for the IRIs. I have rendering set to use\
      \ rdfs:label I also checked the annotations and as far as I can tell these top\
      \ level classes have no annotations at all, at first I was thinking perhaps\
      \ it is using labels like skos:prefLabel and skos:altLabel but I don't see any\
      \ annotation on most of those top level classes at all. If I'm doing something\
      \ wrong please let me know, otherwise I think it would be good to fix this ASAP\
      \ as the ontology is a bit unintuitive when the first thing you see are a bunch\
      \ of classes with no labels and IRIs that are just codes. Also, I ran the Elk\
      \ reasoner in case for some reason that needed to be done to get the labels\
      \ (I can't imagine why that would be needed but you never know) and they still\
      \ didn't have them. \r\n\r\n![EnvoTopClasses](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72980bc7-73d9-43df-a6c2-3e78b6dbe611)\r\

    issue_body: "@turbomam and I are looking at some oddities in OLS\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/EBISPOT/ols4/issues/619\r\

      \n'object aggregate'\r\n and ('has member' some 'hail stone')\r\n```\r\n\r\n\
      We should never have `A subClassOf (B and C)`. This is always equivalent to\

      \ whether C is named or an expression)\r\n\r\nWhile the two are equivalent,\
      \ the latter is always easier for humans, and many tools make assumptions about\

      \ 15 % plagioclase (An 20-30) in subhedral 1-2 mm grains. \r\nThe fundamental\
      \ nature of a rock or sediment is its particulate constitution. Of course, being\
      \ the Earth, there are edge cases that are interesting -- volcanic glass, aphanitic\
      \ materials, monomineralic rocks.    \r\n\r\nI've looked at ENVO several times\

    - "Re: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000813\r\nI'm fine with the Earth\
      \ being an astronomical body. The problem is that OBO have mixed higher classes\
      \ eg \"geographic feature\" with sub-types e.g. \"harbor', \"moraine\" at the\
      \ same level. I would have preferred these, along with \"land form\" to be types\
      \ \"geographic feature\". However, a 'landform' term with the AGI Glossary definition\
      \ as a subtype of \"astronomicla body part\" is at least consistent with some\
      \ of the hierarchy OBO have used."
    - "Yes - this part of the ENVO subsumption hierarchy is very uneven. \r\nThis\
      \ is typical in ENVO - it is good where there has been some concentrated attention,\
      \ such as through a hackathon; elsewhere it is a bit 'first-come-first-served'.\
      \ \r\n\r\nIt tends to get cleaned up in response to a concrete proposal. @smrgeoinfo\
      \ @bsimons14 could you sketch one out, keeping the existing classes but organizing\
      \ them a bit better. And remember - subclasses in OBO must add a differentiator\
      \ to the parent (right @cmungall  @kaiiam @pbuttigieg ?). "

    - "Earthquake is a tricky one. \r\n\r\nFrom an engineering viewpoint, an earthquake\
      \ is ground movement (vibration) at a location, as a result of various source\
      \ phenomena at a distance. The characteristic properties are time, amplitude,\
      \ acceleration etc at the observing location. \r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of\
      \ most geologists and geophysicists, the earthquake is the source phenomenon.\
      \ Usually underground fault-slippage or fracturing, but maybe cavity collapse,\
      \ an underground explosion, etc. The characteristic properties are location,\
      \ timing, focal-mechanism, moment, etc of the natural or artificial phenomenon\
      \ at the source. \r\n\r\nThese phenomena are causally related, but different,\
      \ though often given the same name. "
    - "Thanks @dr-shorthair. Yes we should make a separate ticket for earthquakes.\
      \ \r\n\r\nI guess the question now (as @wdduncan put it in #1072) is do we use\
      \ some simple object properties to replace OPs `has participant` in axioms `like\
      \ has participant min 2 techtonic plate`? Or do we keep those OPs and remove\
      \ the qualified cardinality restrictions (e.g. min 2) from the axiom and maybe\
      \ shove it into an AP on the axiom or similar?"
    - '@kaiiam - great idea to put the cardinality as an axiom annotations on a plain
      existential axiom using the existing object property. Would that be acceptable
      to you @pbuttigieg?'

      \ has participant min 2 techtonic plate`? Or do we keep those OPs and remove\
      \ the qualified cardinality restrictions (e.g. min 2) from the axiom and maybe\
      \ shove it into an AP on the axiom or similar?"
    - '@kaiiam - great idea to put the cardinality as an axiom annotations on a plain
      existential axiom using the existing object property. Would that be acceptable
      to you @pbuttigieg?'
    - "@cmungall are you referring to annotation approach I proposed [here](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/1072#issuecomment-906054179)?\r\
      \n\r\nWe would need to create a annotation (e.g., 'cardinality' or 'qualified\
      \ cardinality constraint') to capture this information. Do you prefer that instead\
      \ of creating a fake object property?"
    - '@wdduncan I was trying to recap what you [had suggested there](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/issues/1072#issuecomment-906054179)
      so we can make a decision on it. @cmungall @pbuttigieg thoughts or preferences? '

      include full synonyms). Do you have a ref for this concept?

    - "Hi, @kaiiam. On Thursday the 5th, @pbuttigieg suggested using DC predicates\

      \ but @pbuttigieg , @wdduncan and I did talk some about recording term contributors\

  - there are also saline evaporation ponds adjacent to salt lakes in continental

  - ah, the joy of opaque identifiers. Can't evaluate this statement without resolving
    the URI...
  - circular.  a mountain range is a range.
  - "gramatically should use 'that' instead of 'which'\r\na cliff that is not adjacent...."
  - the original definition is much better.   To understand this revised definition,
    I have to figure out what you mean by 'beach' and what you mean by 'sea shore'....
  - use 'that'
  - hmmm, wouldn't features on the sea floor (sand waves, biogenic mounds, rift valleys,
    seamounts, reefs) also be considered undersea features?   these are not hydrographic.
  - I think 'a channel constructed by humans' is all you need.
  - "don't complicate with stuff that should be in notes.\r\n'A spring that emits\
    \ water containing a significant amount of dissolved minerals'.\r\nOf course a\
    \ purist might want to know what you mean by 'minerals' "
  - "why 'no longer'???\r\nA valley that does not contain perennial surface water."
  - what about dry valleys in deserts?
  - I'd suggest 'calcium-rich carbonate minerals'.   If its a 'coral' reef, don't
    the 'living organisms' have to be members of that genus?  Is there such a thing
    as a 'non-marine' reef??
  - "simplify\r\n' ... dissolution of soluble bedrock'"
  - a note indicating the connotation of karst association would be useful.
  - perhaps 'a shoreline landform...'   otherwise any cave would meet this definition.
  - I think marine terraces are located along the shore line of  a marine water body;
    many of them are subaerial, not submerged.
  - i assume 'large river' is defined in ENVO?  what does 'determined by a river'
    mean?
  - since the headwaters of a large river a likely to be small rivers, how is this
    different from a 'small river biome'?
  - seem like language like 'a biome hosted by the delta of a river'  would be better
    way to define.  Isn't a biome hosted by some environment?
  - Isn't the essential feature of a slope the fact that is has a surface elevation
    gradient greater than something like 5 degrees?  This definition would include
    flat terraces between a peak and a valley as slopes.
  - original definition is better.

      \n\r\n\r\nYou can immediately see the issue - there's a competition between\
      \ quality-based categorisation (elevated, depressed, can be many others) or\
      \ location-based categorisation (surface, subsurface, submerged). There will\
      \ also always be things that fall outside these categories.\r\n\r\nThis is partially\
      \ resolved by the equivalence axioms on things like `elevated landform` - even\
      \ if a landform occurs in the location-based hierarchy but has the quality of\
      \ `increased elevation`, it will be reasoned into the `elevated landform` hierarchy.\
      \ \r\n\r\nJust like biological taxonomy, I think the processes of formation\
      \ are the most \"natural\" way to sort this out. The rest can be populated by\
      \ inference. \r\n\r\nI don't want to hijack this issue with this topic, so I'll\

    - This makes sense to me PATO elevation is a quality, ENVO elevation is a `solid
      astronomical body part` i.e. independent continuant. and RO `part of` requires

      \ have a generic superclass (i.e. \u201Centanglement\u201D) which would cover\
      \ the general use of the term. From our side there would be no problem with\
      \ moving it under anthropogenic process, since you suggested that this might\
      \ be more appropriate.  \r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n**Entanglement\
      \ of marine life**\r\n> Consider a dog on a beach entangled in fishing gear.\
      \ This satisfies the definition, but is it intentionally included?\r\n\r\nYes,\
      \ I see what you mean with this example, so we should definitely clear that\
      \ up. Changing the term to \u201Centanglement in marine debris\u201D would work\
      \ just as well from our side\r\n\r\n> I would also suggest including marine\
      \ debris as its own class with its own precise definition\r\n\r\nThis is an\
      \ issue we had discussed amongst ourselves before (particularly when adding\
      \ the terms \u201Cmarine anthropogenic litter\u201D, \u201Clittering\u201D and\
      \ when editing \u201Canthropogenic litter\u201D). In those cases we addressed\
      \ the fact that there seems to be no agreement in regards to what distinguishes\
      \ litter and debris in the form of a comment. This is something which we would\

  - I think this fits better under [planned environmental usage process](http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001436),
    and one should be clear about who is doing the catching.
  - ">The anthropogenic environmental process during which abandoned, lost, and discarded\
    \ fishing gear continues to attract and entangle target and non-target species.\r\
    \n\r\n* \"The\" should be the indefinite article instead,\r\n* I'd replace \"\
    ...lost, and discarded\" with \"...lost, or discarded\"\r\n* I'd remove \"continues\
    \ to\" \r\n\r\nThis makes sense under anthropogenic environmental process. "
  - disposed of by whom?
  - '"A state of disuse" is very fuzzy - can you be more concrete? Is that even necessary?'
  - lost = "not been found" is a bit off - please tighten that up
  - German interpretations could include "fischen" and "angeln" (in case you'd like
    to add some multilingual support)
  - "> Fishing gear which has been purposefully left by the owner.\r\n\r\nThe way\
    \ it is phrased now would also include fishing gear that has e.g. been moved onto\
    \ a ship to prepare for an expedition, left there in its designated space, and\
    \ is ready to be used when needed. I'd argue that we wouldn't want that to fall\
    \ under \"abandoned fishing gear\"\r\n\r\nThe previous definition was more clear:\r\
    \n> Fishing gear which has been purposefully left by the owner to fall into a\
    \ state  of disuse.\r\n\r\n@pbuttigieg @iwilkie How would you propose making the\
    \ \"state of disuse\" less \"fuzzy\"?"
  - "Would this be clearer:\r\n\r\n> Fishing gear which has been purposefully left\
    \ by the owner and will not be returned to.\r\n\r\nI do feel as though it is not\
    \ as clear as the way it was phrased before with \"left [...] to fall into a state\
    \ of disuse\"."
  - ">entangles target and non-target species\r\n\r\nI think just saying \"entangles\
    \ organisms.\" is enough. The targeting is not relevant anymore. "
  - ">It is not necessarily driven by the actions of humans, but has been prepared\
    \ by human actions\r\n\r\nSomewhat awkwardly phrased. Do you mean \"While not\
    \ driven by humans directly, ghost fishing is a downstream result of they intentional\
    \ actions\" or similar?"
  - ">has been purposefully left by the owner\r\n\r\nDoesn't quite work. One can purposefully\
    \ leave things around without abandoning them. \r\n\r\nPerhaps: Fishing gear which\
    \ is not under the control of or maintained by its original custodian."
  - ">Fishing gear which is unable to be found and remains in the environment.\r\n\
    \r\nThis is more a definition of unfindable fishing gear, which is an interesting\
    \ idea, but not what we're going for. \r\n\r\nSomething like:\r\n\r\nFishing gear\
    \ which is, unintentionally, no longer under the control of or maintained by its\
    \ original custodian."
  - "> While not driven by humans directly, ghost fishing is a downstream result of\
    \ they intentional actions\r\n\r\nYes, this is what I meant so I'll change it."

  - How did this happen?
  - multiple cases of this
  - On another thread I mentioned that this was about our adding hasDbXref "ENVO"
    to mark the definition source but that robot converted this into URL http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_
    and I didn't notice that weirdness.  I can go in and delete all these manually.  But
    does anyone want to mark that envo curators were the source of the definition
    a different way?
  - '@ddooley I think it is probably best to use oboInOwl:source (or dc:source), whatever
    ENVO uses, instead of hasDBXref..'
  - If I'm not mistaken ENVO uses hasdbxref as annotation on definitions to point
    to definition source.  (Personally, given that a term should have only one definition
    I have been fine with the IAO:0000118 definition source annotation on the term
    itself that other projects use).  At any rate I did a pull request https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/pull/1309  to
    get rid of the bad hasDBXrefs.
  - ">  ENVO uses hasdbxref as annotation on definitions to point to definition source.\

      Clinic is in red as a highlight for the issue I should have commented [edit:\
      \ I see I did leave a comment there] - a discussion of how general a term it\
      \ should be.  As a human construction, does it have broader semantics than just\
      \ a human medical domain?  I'm guessing animal health can be included too, e.g.\

    - "Hey @ddooley thanks for all the work here hopefully between the [ENVO-Robot-template-and-merge-workflow](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/ENVO-Robot-template-and-merge-workflow)\
      \ PR instructions as well as @pbuttigieg's guide to [Creating-good-definitions](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/Creating-good-definitions)\

    - So where it says ENVO basically we didn't draw on any other resource for the
      definition. Often that was because there seemed to be no easy reference to a
      definition for the term or phrase alone, e.g. "subway train".  Should I just
      leave that field empty then?
    - 'I would say briefly try to find something like a Wikipedia reference, these
      are definitional database cross references not claiming to be exact definition
      sources but if there is no such obvious reference then I would say just just
      leave the field empty. '
    - "I merged the PR but I am only now noticing a lot of problems with it, some\

    - Ah - so we were unaware of Jagadish adding the intensive care unit / neonatal
      intensive care unit terms, so this is a collision of two requests for the same
      term showing up in ENVO draft.  I guess his was a smaller request so got approved
      well before our big chunk of terms.  What would you like for deprecation/replacement?  There
      is a "facility" pattern here meant to emphasize the material parts not the organizational
      parts, which OMRSE has more in its domain.
    - "oh I see that's interesting so coincidentally we had two PRs from two different\
      \ people both adding roughly similar content, fun!\r\n\r\nThe fact that we ended\
      \ up with two parallel hierarchies rather than in the same place is an interesting\
      \ N-of-2 annotation consistency experiment. This suggests that we have too many\
      \ ontological ways of slicing and dicing things\r\n\r\nand also that we need\
      \ to merge PRs faster!\r\n\r\ntho it's not clear why they both showed up in\
      \ your PR - maybe there was a merge that didn't rebase/no-ff?\r\n\r\nanyway\
      \ I think \"building part\" should be structural parts, functional units like\
      \ NICU should go in facility. Agreed @pbuttigieg ?"
    - "Although I agree I'd be nice to merge PRs faster I think we should try to be\
      \ careful about checking conflicts prior to merging. I understand if the first\
      \ batch had been merged prior to the second being added the second could have\
      \ more easily found existing terms similar to those in the 2nd request. \r\n\
      \r\nPerhaps we could add something like automated synonym checks to the build\
      \ routine? ATM I believe it'll give warning about duplicate EQ classes, labels\
      \ and defs but what about duplicate synonyms? Could we implement something like\
      \ a cosine or hamming distance function for labels to identify potential duplicates? "

    \ of `permanent hair dye`. \r\nThe textual definition is not sufficiently linked\
    \ to the axioms either.\r\n\r\nLooks like there should be a sub-hierarchy for\
    \ \"dyes\", but that's more a role than anything metaphysical. \r\n\r\nLooking\
    \ at the axioms, this is more (skipping better superclasses) \"A liquid environmental\
    \ material which is 1) manufactured, 2) composed primarily of hydrogen peroxide\
    \ and ammonia 3) used to permanently alter hair colour\" \r\n\r\nOn 2) I don't\
    \ know if these are the primary constituents, but you get the idea - we need differntia\
    \ in the textual and axiomatic definitions focused on what the thing is, rather\
    \ than its role.\r\n\r\nOn 3) - nothing permanently does anything - what is the\
    \ actual standard threshold for a dye to be considered \"permanent\"?"
  - 'Consider the comments above - same issues here. There should be an ink hierarchy,
    probably dovetailing with the dye hierarchy, focusing on the actual chemical properties
    of these materials (which include aromatic groups or similar that absorb visible
    light) '
  - "Perhaps improving the definition of \"ink\" ENVO:03510065 and moving this under\
    \ it will help.\r\n"
  - "Move to env material hierarchy - is there no CHEBI role for colourant? That would\
    \ help us with inks, dyes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe textual definition has a few issues:\r\
    \n>A manufactured product which contains a colourant that is used to imprint upon\
    \ materials.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to use it to imprint on anything in order for\
    \ it to be ink (intended use vs. realised role), maybe the capable of relation/wording\
    \ is better to support later axiomatisation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps: \"An environmental\
    \ material which contains at least one substance capable of absorbing light in\
    \ the visible range\"\r\n\r\n"
  - ">A slow drying ink which is made from refined soybean oil.\r\n\r\nThe \"slow\
    \ drying\" is extraneous and messes up the definition pattern.\r\nOn the axioms,\
    \ I don't think the pigments have to be biological - that axiom should be broadened\
    \ \r\n"
  - ">A coloring agent which is used to deposit color onto a substrate via an inkjet\
    \ printer.\r\n\r\nAgain, the definition pattern is off. Further, this definition\
    \ doesn't make sense. The colouring agent isn't used to deposit anything. \r\n\
    \r\nGiven that you have wax, resin, and aqueous inks noted, it would make sense\
    \ to include defined (with equivalence axioms) subclasses of ink to contain them.\
    \ Not essential, but would be good to take the opportunity."
  - As above, the definition and positioning are off/inaccurate
  - "The parent of 'emissions from petroleum combustion' is now 'environmental material'.\
    \ The definition has been adapted as well, and an axiom for 'produced_by' some\
    \ 'combustion process' has been included. We did not find a suitable example to\
    \ model the occurs in relationship after.\r\n"
  - 'The definition has been revised for ''rubber cement'' to reflect this recommendation.
    Axioms regarding the inclusion of ''rubber particle'' and ''alcohol'' have been
    maintained (as they are accurate for all instances of rubber cement) and can be
    added to the textual definition if required. '
  - '''Wallpaper paste'' has been placed as a subclass of glue and the textual definition
    modified as recommended. '
  - "In references to the variety of terms that fall under the category of ink/dye/colorant\
    \ etc. We have included two new subclasses of 'environmental material' called\
    \ 'colorant fluid' and 'chemical colorant'. Both are considered manufactured.\
    \ \r\nBelow these two classes the following have become subclasses:\r\nUnder 'colorant\
    \ fluid': 'pharmaceutical ink', 'gel ink', 'soy ink', ' and 'aqueous inkjet printer\
    \ ink'\r\nUnder 'chemical colorant': 'permanent hair dye'\r\n\r\nAll definitions\
    \ for these indicated subclasses have been updated to reflect their classification\
    \ and composition with recommendations taken from your notes. Please advise any\
    \ further revisions. Thanks!"
  - Thanks @laurenechan - will examine the latest files
  - Thanks @laurenechan - 'colorant fluid' and chemical colorant still sound very
    role-based - I'll look at the latest file to see how this can work.

      \ ENVO entity attribute [csv](https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/blob/master/src/envo/modules/entity_attribute.csv)\

      \ files for an example. \r\n\r\nUsing this we could produce compositional terms\

      \ e.g. are you just going to have one (or a set number of) `has part some X`\
      \ axiom per term? If so a DOSDP would be ideal, if not (and there are multiple\
      \ possible has part relationships) we could employ a Robot template. \r\n\r\n\

    - "Hi @kaiiam , here are some of the things we were hoping to be able to encompass\
      \ in the mixture terms:\r\n- Mixtures with differing quantities of components\
      \ (some have 2, some have 10+)\r\n- Mixtures with \"potential\" components,\
      \ i.e. some rubber cement is made with acetone and another is made with ethanol,\
      \ we hope to include all of the \"potential\" and \"certain\" components to\
      \ the mixture terms\r\n- We are primarily interested in using ChEBI terms for\
      \ these, but also have ENVO and FoodOn terms included in some mixtures\r\n\r\

      \ A is exposed to a variety of mixtures, environments, etc., and organism B\
      \ is exposed to a completely different variety of mixtures etc, yet they have\
      \ some similar disease/phenotype/outcome, what are the individual components\
      \ each organism is exposed to (parts of mixtures) that may be similar and potentially\

    - "Hey @laurenechan I'm wondering if you can leverage owl equivalence axioms to\
      \ allow for entailment and inference from the reasoner. I'd suggest you take\
      \ a look at Chris mungall's blog post on [rector-normalization](https://douroucouli.wordpress.com/2019/06/29/ontotip-learn-the-rector-normalization-technique/)\
      \ (the rest of the blog is also a treasure trove which I'm slowly working through).\r\
      \n\r\nThe long and short of it is that when you have equivalence classes that\
      \ expresses conditions, e.g., `class 1` has properties `A, B and C`, and `class\
      \ 2` has properties `A and B`, then the reasoner can figure out that `class\
      \ 1` should be subclass to `class 2`. Similarly here, mixtures will have sets\
      \ of parts, if you list each out as a sum of it's parts within owl equivalence\
      \ class axioms, (as per @diatomsRcool's example: e.g., Rubber cement = manufactured\
      \ product and has part some X1 and has part some X2....etc), you'll allow the\
      \ reasoner to figure out the hierarchy of mixture classes. I did a little demo\
      \ similar to this idea [here](https://github.com/Southern-Cross-Plant-Science/cdno/issues/4#issuecomment-677436009)\
      \ just look at that comment (don't worry about the rest of the thread). \r\n\
      \r\nMy suggestion would be for you to just play around with this idea, you could\
      \ use [ODK](https://github.com/INCATools/ontology-development-kit/tree/master/odk)\
      \ to launch yourself a test application ontology, or even simpler just clone\
      \ a \"sandbox\" version of ENVO to experiment in (just don't make any weird\
      \ pushes or pull requests from the sandbox version). \r\n\r\nLet me know if\
      \ these suggestions seem useful to you and if you have any questions, or want\
      \ to try this out, and want my help doing so. It would be ideal if you (or we)\
      \ can figure out some consistent owl equivalence   for the axioms of these classes.\
      \ If so we could later maybe implement them within design patterns such as those\
      \ produced by Robot or DOSDP. "

    - I'm guessing the soybean oil mentioned above is food-grade soybean oil?  I think
      the semantic wiggle room with a food product is that its manufacture meets health
      and organoleptic standards; whether it is actually used as food or goes to waste,
      or ends up in playdough or some other intention does not preclude referencing
      it.

      \ cases:\r\n\r\n1) A mixture `A` can be exhaustively defined as a mix of a set\

      \ `A` is contains (among others) one of two compounds, for example, \"sugar\
      \ or sweetener\".\r\n\r\nIs it {`A sub: hasCompound some C1`,  `A sub hasCompound\
      \ some C2`,...} for both 1 and 2? And A sub hasCompound some (C4 or C5) is considered\
      \ too rococo?\r\n\r\n> don't include potential members with has-part. even if\

    - "After talking to @cmungall about the modelling in this PR, I now understand\
      \ my modelling error. The problem is that modelling mixtures as an intersection\
      \ (a sequence of AND statements) of existential restrictions (has part some\
      \ mixture part) is only half of the equation - what is missing is \"closure\"\
      . Before I explain this @laurenechan sorry that this very general discussion\
      \ here is being had on your ticket - this has nothing to do with your terms,\
      \ and is a general discussion on a pattern.\r\n\r\nRight now, when I say:\r\n\
      \r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution A:\r\ncoffee = mixture that has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water\r\ntiramisu = mixture that has part some coffee\
      \ beans and has part some water and has part some sugar\r\n```\r\n\r\nwe would\
      \ get that Tiramisu is a kind of coffee - which is obviously bogus - it just\
      \ contains coffee (please don't judge my recipe above - it needs some work).\
      \ So the correct way to model this would be:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Modeling solution\
      \ B:\r\ncoffee = mixture that has part some coffee beans and has part some water\
      \ and has part only (coffee beans or water)\r\ntiramisu = mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part some sugar and has\
      \ part only (coffee beans or water or sugar)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow we get a bit\
      \ into rococco land (@cmungall way of saying: complex OWL that is easy to get\
      \ wrong and unusable by external tools).\r\n\r\nFor completeness, I just add\
      \ modeling solution C&D as well, so we have them all in the same comment:\r\n\

      \ No access to \"exhaustive list\".\r\n\r\nIts obvious that only solutions B\
      \ and D matter to this discussion. I can't tell you what to do @kaiiam, but\
      \ here is my preferred solution (MIX_ALT1):\r\n\r\n1. Use Solution B, but add\
      \ a separate module to ENVO that _asserts_ the subsumption derived from the\
      \ mixtures. Here is an example of how we do this as part of [DPO](https://github.com/FlyBase/drosophila-phenotype-ontology/blob/072665bfa9abf70a1eae240f661ab09f64a20d99/src/ontology/dpo.Makefile#L118).\
      \ This allows you to use ELK in your day2day business and only need Hermit (or\
      \ Konclude, which is what we do) once when you create a release.\r\n2. Make\
      \ sure that you run ROBOT relax on the OWL product after compiling the pattern\
      \ this gives you some version of D as well.\r\n\r\nThe alternative MIX_ALT2\
      \ is this:\r\n1. Go with Solution D, but add a dosdp pattern that states that\
      \ if you are a mixture, your ingredient list can be considered exhaustive. \r\
      \n2. You need to manually assert all subsumptions between mixtures.\r\n\r\n\
      Let me know what you think. To alleviate some of the stress of @diatomsRcool\
      \ and @laurenechan you can also just add the terms so they can consider the\
      \ matter closed, while we still figure out how to do the modelling.\r\n\r\n"
    - "solution B is not correct because it mixes universals and transitive predicates.\
      \ Tiramisu and coffee both have atoms and quarks.\r\n\r\n(I know you know this\
      \ and just forgot... :-)\r\n\r\n(aside: this kind of trap is why I always say:\
      \ keep it simple. avoid non-EL constructs unless you're really sure they are\
      \ necessary for reasoning)\r\n\r\nOne way to get around this is to invent a\
      \ non-transitive subpredicate. RO has has_component for this purpose. But this\
      \ is problematic. Inference will be incomplete since sometimes you want the\
      \ transitivity\r\n\r\nAnother way is to do this.\r\n\r\n`mixture that has part\
      \ some coffee beans and has part some water and has part only (coffee beans\
      \ or water or (part-of some coffee beans) or (part-of some water))`\r\n\r\n\
      but this is complex, you'll never get classification from elk"
    - "Ahhhhh!!! How embarrassing!!!\r\n\r\nThat was a long ticket and one that illustrates\
      \ nicely the problem of complicated modelling.\r\n\r\nOK, I guess I suggest\
      \ then to go for `MIX_ALT2` solution.\r\n\r\nIf no one disagrees, I will finalise\
      \ the template with Lauren, and @kaiiam can merge it in. Thanks for all the\
      \ feedback!\r\n"

      \ As for the label/synonym reflecting the meaning, I think based on conversations\

      \ But we can ask @rduerr if there are other blue ice synonyms or if she has\

      \ try to fix the incorrect uses of `ice` intended to be `water ice`. Regarding\

      \ SWEET actually maps to BFO, perhaps we change the mapping of http://sweetontology.net/realmCryo/IceSurface\

    - "OK weighing in here; I wasn't involved in all of these definitions; but did\
      \ notice based on this ticket that yes, there are some screwy things in the\
      \ current hierarchy, though they aren't quite the same things as @cmungall is\
      \ talking about, though I will try to address at least some of those comments\
      \ as well.  \r\n\r\nMy first complaint is that the terms under sea ice floe\
      \ (nilas, pancake ice, young ice) are not necessarily sea ice floes...  Two\
      \ of of those terms (frazil & shuga) plus all of the New ice terms and several\
      \ of the terms under sea ice (first year ice, multiyear ice, second year ice)\
      \ are actually terms describing the stages in the life of sea ice which starts\
      \ off as either frazil or shuga which then progresses to new ice and eventually\
      \ first-year, etc. ice.  Pancake ice is also not a floe it is an ice form. \
      \ In general the Earth sea ice community has standardized terminology along\
      \ 3 dimensions - concentration, form and stage (which is a proxy for age). \
      \ Yes, there are other terms in use; but those are the major characteristics\
      \ of Earth's sea water ice (even if NOAA uses some of the same terminology for\
      \ fresh water ice) and which show up everywhere in the literature and on sea\
      \ ice maps used by shipping companies, etc.  I suggest that concentration, form,\
      \ and stage are qualities that sea ice has?\r\n\r\nSecond there are glaciers\
      \ on both Mars and Pluto. I would say that glacier needs to come out from under\
      \ water ice since Pluto has glaciers made of nitrogen.\r\n\r\n> Continuing ice\

      > I'm not sure how this grouping class helps?\r\n\r\nI tend to agree - the issue\
      \ is that NOAA uses the same terms for young and new ice for Great Lakes ice\
      \ as they do for sea ice.  However, the ice on the great lakes melts out completely\
      \ each summer so the terms for late stages of the life of ice (e.g., first year,\
      \ second year, multiyear) don't apply.  Personally, I think we should just make\
      \ the Great Lakes a special subset that parallels the stages of sea ice but\
      \ doesn't include terms that don't apply.  As far as I know other countries\

      \ they can be intensified when occurring on slopes or in\r\ngullies that have\
      \ been denuded of vegetation due to wildfires or forest\r\nlogging. They are\
      \ common in volcanic areas with weak soil.\r\nRelative size/range\r\nThese types\
      \ of flows can be thin and watery or thick with sediment and\r\ndebris and are\
      \ usually confined to the dimensions of the steep gullies\r\nthat facilitate\
      \ their downward movement. Generally the movement is\r\nrelatively shallow and\
      \ the runout is both long and narrow, sometimes\r\nextending for kilometers\
      \ in steep terrain. The debris and mud usually\r\nterminate at the base of the\
      \ slopes and create fanlike, triangular deposits\r\ncalled debris fans, which\
      \ may also be unstable.\r\nVelocity of travel\r\nCan be rapid to extremely rapid\
      \ (35 miles per hour or 56 km per hour)\r\ndepending on consistency and slope\

      \ incorporate large boulders and\r\nother pieces of debris. They can move objects\
      \ as large as houses in\r\ntheir downslope flow or can fill structures with\

      \ type of sediment-water flow in which the sediment and water mixture becomes\
      \ a slurry, similar to wet concrete, capable of holding gravel-sized particles\
      \ in suspension when flowing slowly or stopped. Debris flows are usually confined\
      \ to the dimensions of the steep gullies that facilitate their downward movement.\
      \ Generally the movement is relatively shallow and the runout is both long and\
      \ narrow, sometimes extending for kilometers in steep terrain. Velocity of travel\
      \ can be rapid to extremely rapid (35 miles per hour or 56 km per hour) depending\
      \ on consistency and slope angle.\r\nDebris flows are non-Newtonian viscoplastic\
      \ or dilatant fluids having laminar flow and uniform sediment concentration\
      \ profiles, sediment concentrations ranging 70-90 % by weight (47-77% by volume),\
      \ and shear strengths greater than about 400 dynes/cm2. In debris flows solid\
      \ particles and water move together as a single viscoplastic body. Sediment\
      \ entrainment is irreversible, water and solids move at the same velocity, and\
      \ debris flows cannot deposit any but the coarsest particles as flow velocities\
      \ decrease. Shear is concentrated in a thin zone at the flow boundaries.\r\n\

    - 'See linked ticket for comment on NPO tracker


      NPO models radiation, waves and energy in what appears to be a very sensible
      manner. It''s not clear if all of these are required to be imported in ENVO,
      but I can see this being useful in a variety of contexts. Energy is obviously
      an important concept when looking at some of the wider ENVO use cases.


      See this figure for an example of R/W/E in NPO (subclasses denoted by containment):

    - Actually, the GEMET root definition can apply to unplanned deforestation too.
      I'm moving the examples, but keeping the mapping
    - '@cmungall `planned process` doesn''t have any equivalence axioms imported -
      how do we make that happen to add the scattered planned processes under one
      node for convenience?'
    - I would just do as a simple intersection between 2 named classes for now, e.g.

      As far as glass, one very common kind of glass in EarthScience is volcanic glass,\
      \ certainly not anthropogenic. Doesn't glass denote a material that has undergone\
      \ a liquid-solid transition in such a way that no regular crystal lattice is\
      \ formed?  Nothing to do with anthropogenic as a sufficient property."
    - "Indeed, volcanic glass is the kind of thing I was thinking of when I said that\

      \ (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/bto/terms?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.obolibrary.org%2Fobo%2FBTO_0003810).\

    - 'Hi @gecko1990


      What kind of enrichment is it? We can likely create a more precise class for
      this and link it to the environment the source material came from. '
    - Indeed, the enrichment culture derives from thermophilic sediment in a hydrothermal
      vent area.
    - 'Does this not belong in OBI?

      '
    - What is OBI?
    - "Hey @pbuttigieg I like your idea. The enrichment is derived from sediment of\
      \ a hydrothermal vent field from the Guaymas Basin. It is anoxic, thermophilic\
      \ and sulfate-reducing sediment. It might be connected to these terms:\r\nmarine\
      \ hydrothermal vent biome [ENVO:01000030]\r\nthermophilic sediment [ENVO:01000132]\r\
      \nsulphate-reducing sediment [ENVO:01000153] \r\n"
    - ">Does this not belong in OBI?\r\n\r\n@cmungall no, not the culture itself -\
      \ the planned process would though and it would be good to have it for axiomatisation\
      \ (probably not in ENVO itself, but at the application level)\r\n\r\n> Hey @pbuttigieg\

    - "The definition that appears in BRENDA is the following: An enrichment culture\
      \ is a medium with specific and known qualities that favors the growth of a\
      \ particular microorganism. The enrichment cultures environment will support\
      \ the growth of a selected microorganism, while inhibiting the growth of others.\r\
      \nIt is not bad but it refers to the medium when I think we should refer to\
      \ the microcosm. Important factors are:\r\n- It is not a pure culture.\r\n-\
      \ Although you desire to be stable, the community can change over time.\r\n\
      - You want to select specific organisms and processes by providing the right\
      \ conditions, growth substrates... These conditions should not favor or will\
      \ not select other members of the original community. \r\n\r\nWe talk about\
      \ these enrichment cultures in the following paper: Establishing anaerobic hydrocarbon-degrading\
      \ enrichment cultures of microorganisms under strictly anoxic conditions. doi:10.1038/nprot.2018.030\r\
      \n\r\nMy ORCID: http://orcid.org/0000-0002-6912-7865"
    - "Hi @gecko1990 \r\n\r\nI've set up a few classes to allow you to talk about\
      \ the enrichment culturing unit, the culture medium itself, and the sum of the\
      \ two. \r\n\r\nI avoided pre-composing a very specific class, but you should\
      \ have the right ingredients for a good MIxS entry.\r\n\r\nI would suggest the\
      \ following annotation:\r\n\r\n```\r\nSlot 1: urban biome [ENVO:01000249], temperate\
      \ biome [ENVO:01001831]\r\nSlot 2: active sulphate-reducing enrichment culturing\
      \ unit [ENVO:01001826]\r\nSlot 3: thermophilic sediment [ENVO:01000132], sulphate-reducing\
      \ sediment [ENVO:01000153], hydrothermally-influenced sediment [ENVO:01001821]\r\
      \n```\r\n\r\nWithin the expressivity limitations of the MIxS annotation system,\
      \ this should link your data with the right semantics. That is:\r\n* you have\
      \ sediment that is thermophillic, sulphate-reducing, and hydrothermally-influenced\r\
      \n* that sediment is in an enrichment culturing unit, set up to promote sulphate-reduction\r\
      \n* that unit is located in an urban biome and a temperate biome (where your\
      \ lab is)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe IRIs are now set - but the classes will only be live\
      \ after our next release.\r\n \r\nPS: This took some time as I had to refactor\
      \ the hierarchy dealing with cell/tissue cultures, altering the material and\
      \ manufactured product hierarchies in the process. That's still not done by\
      \ any means, but it's in better shape for further development.\r\n"
    - 'PS: it''s not strictly the case, by you may consider `petroleum contaminated
      sediment` [ENVO:00002115] in the material slot too. That class may undergo a
      label change to "petroleum-enriched sediment" to match its axioms. '
    - Thanks a lot! I was checking the ENVO terms and I missed the term "hydrothermal
      field". There is hydrothermal vent but the "field" term would refer to an area
      influenced by hydrothermal vents. Would it be possible to create it?
    - Sure @gecko1990! I'll create a separate issue for that ...

    issue_title: xref for definition of 'area of lichen dominated vegetation' does
      not resolve
    issue_body: "definition \"An area of a planet's surface which is primarily covered\
      \ by fruticose or foliose lichens and which is in contact with an atmospheric\
      \ column extending from the planetary boundary layer to the planet's exosphere\
      \ with little to no physical obstruction.\"\r\n\r\nhttps://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_leg.php\r\
      \n\r\n(the other two are wikipedia)\r\n\r\n\r\ncomment: This class is in need\
      \ of refinement, particularly in linking to other entities in the ontology.\
      \ However, it is suitable for use in annotating remotely sensed land types.\r\
      \n\r\nI was looking as I had questions about the axioms:\r\n\r\n 1. 'adjacent\
      \ to' some 'atmospheric boundary layer'\r\n 2. 'part of' some 'planetary surface'\r\
      \n 3. 'part of' some 'tundra biome'\r\n 4. 'vegetated area'\r\n\r\n1 and 2 are\
      \ fine, but it seems odd to assert directly on this class rather than inferred\
      \ via a suitable parent.\r\n\r\n4 is true by definition\r\n\r\nBut I was most\
      \ curious about 3. Is it true that all lichen-dominated areas are parts of tundra\
      \ biomes?\r\n\r\nE.g.\r\n\r\nlichen-dominated biocrusts:\r\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26084731\r\
      \n\r\nfrom here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurbant%C3%BCngg%C3%BCt_Desert\r\
      \n\r\nIs this area a tundra? I am not convinced\r\n\r\n(it would be great to\
      \ have more disjointness axioms in the ontology to detect possible inconsistencies)\r\
      \n\r\nWe do have this comment which is maybe relevant here:\r\n\r\n_According\
      \ to the NLCD 2011, at least 80% of these areas are covered by lichens.  Such\
      \ thresholds - which are themselves fuzzy - are not strictly asserted in this\
      \ definition. The original definition notes that this is intended as an \"Alaska\
      \ only\" category._"

    - "The resource must be down on the other end of the xref. This is inevitable\
      \ for many cases. Is there an OBO SOP here? Marking it as \"dead\"?\r\n\r\n\
      In terms of lichen dominance, the examples you list are at a very different\
      \ scale. I think the inconsistency is best resolved through spatial thresholding,\

    - On a related note, I just got off a call with @mobb and @amoeba and we found
      several terms with dbxrefs that don't resolve -- they point to a LTER server
      that moved.  For example, `ocean` has a link to `http://129.24.124.196/vocab/vocab/index.php?tema=127&/coral-reefs`
      (this might be the wrong link too).  Should I update these xrefs?
    - "Hi @stevenchong, is this something we can script? That is, was this a structured\
      \ move? \r\n\r\n@cmungall any response to how we handle obsolete xrefs? I wouldn't\
      \ change it unless we also validate that the new xref points to identical (or\
      \ at least very similar) content."
    - "> Hi @stevenchong, is this something we can script? That is, was this a structured\
      \ move?\r\nThe LTER vocab now lives here: https://vocab.lternet.edu/vocab/vocab/index.php.\
      \ The link for coral reefs is: `https://vocab.lternet.edu/vocab/vocab/index.php?tema=127&/coral-reefs`.\
      \  I checked a few of the xrefs (12 total) and it looks like they follow the\
      \ same pattern.\r\n\r\nThere was also a question about why `ocean` (in envo-edit)\
      \ was xref'ed to `http://129.24.124.196/vocab/vocab/index.php?tema=127&/coral-reefs`\
      \ rather than the LTER `oceans` term.\r\n\r\n"
    - 'That''s a bug, will fix '
    - "@stevenchong would you like to try to update these xrefs? \r\nYou'd likely\
      \ do this either in a text editor or with sed/awk rather than Prot\xE9g\xE9\
      . Please ensure that UNIX line endings are preserved.\r\n\r\nYou can fold this\

    - Sure, I'll give it a shot. Should I just update the links or is there another
      process to follow for obsoleting the xrefs?

  - Please add a comment here saying that "zones" will likely be aligned to BFO:site
    and thus "occurs in" relations can be used.
  - "I suppose microbes are particulate matter, in a sense; however, I think that\

  - "Minor rephrasing:\r\n```\r\nA depression or hole which forms vertically within\

    \ anywhere? If not, we should queue that for ENVO spatial semantics ( xref #449\
    \ ). Could you make an issue for vertical and horizontal?"
  - "Rephrasing and corrections:\r\n\r\n```\r\nA water body which forms as a result\

  - 'PS: Is this in envoPolar? It should be if not - please do a sweep through our
    recent terms and legacy terms, adding the envoPolar subset ID as needed.'
  - "It's interesting to see this as a material accumulation process. A comment explaining\

    ```\r\nA material accumulation process during which brine droplets, trapped between\

  - "Unlike accumulation, we don't need to refer to sites here as we're dealing with\

    \ rather than things like the conversion of a specific chemical into another.\
    \ The latter case belongs in the CHEBI/REX realm."
  - Can we not say `has input` instead of `has participant` here?
  - You can move the second sentence to a comment.
  - Again, see if this can be sharpened to `has input`
  - Is this better labelled as "brine rejection from seawater"?
  - "```\r\nIce which is composed of small, needle-like crystals consisting of nearly\

    \ ambiguous, I'd label this `frazil ice` and use the `surrounded by` relation\
    \ to `seawater`.\r\n\r\nPlease make an editor note saying that this should be\

  - This doesn't sound like a def for the formation of frazil, but for the transformation
    of frazil ice into a more continuous and consolidated form of ice.
  - "This def needs work. Rephrasing should be done looking at the suggestion in this\
    \ review for cryoconite hole. More importantly, is the puddle doing the melting?\

  - Hey @pbuttigieg @jzrapp I think adding the fact sea ice [floats on the ocean](http://nsidc.org/cryosphere/sotc/sea_ice.html)
    surface to the definition of sea ice address your concerns over the semantics
    of floating ice. I'm currently working on categorizing the [various stages of
    sea ice development](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/glossary-terms/sea-ice?page=2)
    adding classes for new ice, nilas, young ice, and multiyear ice, all of which
    are to be subclasses of sea ice.
  - "@jzrapp This is more to indicate that the ice is on top of some medium upon which\
    \ it floats. It's subclasses will be, e.g., sea ice and lake ice. You're right\
    \ that the label can be confusing, as it suggests non-floating ice is a sibling.\

    \ some 'young ice' \r\n> 'has input' some ('sea water' and nilas)\r\n\r\nfor first\
    \ year ice formation process, I'll change the comment to:\r\n```\r\nFirst year\
    \ ice that survives melting during spring and summer can transition to second\

    \ make new ice a union class, we don't need to make the various kinds of new ice\
    \ subclasses (the reasoner will do that). We'd just have them as subclasses of\
    \ water ice.\r\n\r\nSo I will change frazil ice to be a subclass of new ice instead\
    \ of water ice crystal \r\n\r\nI'll add shuga as subclass of new ice:\r\n```\r\

    \ is, the frazil ice hasn't been altered) then maybe this isn't a material but\
    \ a grease ice layer (subclass of layer).\r\n   \r\nI'll make grease ice layer\
